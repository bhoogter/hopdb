The Australian House of Prayer for All Nations Adelaide, was founded in 1990 in Adelaide by Ps Jenny Hagger as a worship, prayer, research and networking centre that trains and equips intercessors throughout Australia to go out on strategic prayer assignments locally, nationally and internationally. Teams are also regularly involved in key reconciliation initiatives.
Revival SA city-wide prayer meetings are held on the first Saturday of each month in Adelaide and are attended by over 150 intercessors from many different congregations and all are welcome.
The Lighthouse Prayer Tower premises were purchased in the CBD of Adelaide in 2008, where teams now pray daily into the Seven Mountains of Society.
in 2011 AHOPFAN purchased a motel on Kangaroo island in SA, to be their third house of prayer, as well as being a Christian Conference and Retreat Centre.
Mission World Aid operates as the international mercy ministry of AHOPFAN and since 1992 has sent 133 shipping containers of aid to over 25 nations.

Ps Jenny Hagger has a heart for unity in the Body of Christ and carries a prophetic/apostolic breakthrough anointing. Jenny is passionate to encourage others to come into the freedom of Davidic worship and intimacy with the Lord. Her desire is to see the establishment of houses of prayer throughout Australia and into the nations of the world.
Jenny was instrumental in the setting up of a ten year exhibition in the State Library displaying South Australias Christian Heritage.
Weekly prayer meetings began inside Parliament House in South Australia in 2003 under her leadership and she is the SA Regional Coordinator for the Parliamentary Prayer Network.
Recently Jenny was asked to be the Regional Coordinator for the South Pacific for Transform Worlds Celebration Challenge which includes networking with houses of prayer in each region.
Jenny is co-pastor with her husband Brian of Zion Hill Christian Community, which they began in 2006.
In 2008 she was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her involvement in the prayer movement in Australia, and for the work of Mission World Aid.
Jenny and Brian have three sons and five grandchildren.]]></description>

What is the Prayer Room?

The Commission Prayer Room is really a community of people who are committed to night and day worshiped-based prayer and then reaching people at their point of need in Brussels and Europe.   It is a missions base that is gathered around a prayer room.

We believe that the government of God is released on earth through prayer.  That when night and day prayer is established in a city, the spiritual atmosphere begins to change.  Hearts and minds open to the gospel.  Spiritual oppression is broken and the spirit of revival is released.    The Prayer Room is about establishing night and day prayer in Brussels, Belgium the capital of the EU through a praying community of believers.

Why Brussels?

Brussels is one of the most influential cities in the world and is affectionately known as the ?heart of Europe?.  Brussels has been a main center for international politics. Hosting principal EU institutions as well as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and home of numerous international organizations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants.  Brussels is where Europe is led.   It is in this context, joining with many other significant prayer ministries targeting Brussels, that Commission Prayer Room has begun. The Commission Prayer Room is just a few buildings down from the European Commission Building located in the heart of the European distric]]></description>

IHOP-Caratinga - International House of Prayer in Caratinga, has as its vision to dwell in continuous worship and intercession of the House of Prayer built by God, now keeping the flame lit in prayer and worship as in the Biblical example of the Tent of David until the day of restoration of all things. According to the mind of Christ, train, equip and send missionaries to operate in intercessory worship precursor spirit that God has bestowed in recent days to raise prayer rooms 24 hours in Brazil and worldwide, equipping the Bride of Christ to be wise not lack oil in your lamp, giving all authority and freedom to the Holy Spirit to direct, advise and build his Church, but without denominational barriers with a vision of the Kingdom, according to the prayer of Jesus, Our Father which art in heaven, come to us Thy kingdom, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. "

The Holy Spirit has orchestrated an international move of intercession and worship. Harps and cups are being raised to God before the throne of the Father, and in view of the apostle John (Revelation 5:8).

Them joyful in My house of prayer ... My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples (Isaiah 56:7) We believe in a joyful prayer and worship a living that comes from Gods throne.

Christ is the High Priest of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, not man. (Hebrews 8:2). He is also the very tabernacle which the Lord rose from the ruins (resurrection - Acts 15:16) as the body of Christ on earth today serves as a living temple, the temple of the eternal God, of which we are living stones in this spiritual house (1 Peter 2:5) where we offer spiritual sacrifices directed to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Prayer and worship 24 hours 7 days a week, are at the heart of our calling as this comes straight from the heart of God for this time. Prayer and worship are also proven and approved as fuel revivals throughout history. We believe that there will be different in recent days.

We meet the target of prayer warriors and worshipers whether ministerial or flag names to call this nation to repentance first and then the search for intimacy with God which He separated for the last days. We pray for healing and restoration for Brazil and for the nations.

Houses of Prayer have multiplied around the world. God is releasing freedom in worship, and training missionaries to reach the nations. It is the plan of Fathers heart for this time in prayer together with social work (acts of justice), restoration of lives and bring transformation in society around. God commands the blessing on the drive when there is a people who pray and fast together (Psalm 133). Through faith, from prayer and communion with God, mountains are moved, waste places are restored and lives are transported from darkness to light.

God has brought missionaries from around the world to stand together an altar of worship in Brazil that can fill the cups of gold in heaven so that God continues to pour from the top justice in the form of healing, restoration, signs and wonders.

Pastors Peter and Anya Braconnot, are the directors of the IHOP-Caratinga.

"We believe that God will still raise a lot of prayer house in Brazil and worldwide. This is part of preparation for the return of the Lord in these last hours."]]></description>

Primary Mission
The primary mission and first step is to establish the House of Prayer. We believe that through worship, God?s presence will invade and permeate every area of society, bringing justice for His elect (Luke 18:8). Endeavor to function in the spirit of the Tabernacle of David with weekly prayer meetings and live music, singing and intercessory prayer.

Children Who Contend For God
Worship music will be the medium through which God will govern the earth. Those who worship God in spirit and in truth will be able to sustain a life in God as the end-time judgments become manifest in the world. Singing God?s Word is a way to sustain a life in Him. God has willed that singing be what causes our hearts to be overwhelmed with God?s love and emotions and causes us to go deeper in the Word of God, thus fulfilling Proverbs 2. Minister to the children through song and teach them to sing as the primary means by which they commune with their Lord (Col 3:16-17 and Eph 5:17-20). 

Prayer should not consist of a weekly meeting that lasts for an hour, during which we ask the Lord to bless what we?re doing. Prayer should be a continual and ever-present way of life to cry out for a breaking in of God?s divine presence and asking Him to transform the city, region and country where we live. Prayer and worship will never cease to rise before the throne of God as those who were once orphans but now have a new found heavenly Father become musicians and intercessors who minister to God and give Him the glory due His name. It will take that level of intercession and prayer to dispel the darkness that has permeated these dark regions for thousands of years]]></description>

<br/>
Durham House of Prayer is an emerging prayer furnace serving the Body of Christ in the Durham region.  Our vision is ?seeking God, seeing transformation night and day.?

Our mission is:

To encounter the heart of God personally in prayer and worship (Psalm 27:4,8).  When the first commandment is first in our lives, then we know His heart for others in a greater way
To fuel passion for Jesus by equipping believers in a lifestyle of prayer and intimacy.  God is raising up a generation that is wholehearted in its pursuit (Psalm 24:6).  We believe God is the only one who can satisfy this pursuit  in the place of prayer.  He draws us to the place of prayer because He desires to communicate His intentions. (Gary Wiens)
To cover the Durham Region with an on-going canopy of prayer and worship.  The spiritual atmosphere of our region will be changed with increased prayer.
To pursue regional unity (Psalm 133), connecting the body of Christ together.
The Lord promises to bring about speedy justice to those who cry out to Him day and night (Luke 18:7).  Our desire is to keep the fire of prayer and worship burning continuously in the region (Isaiah 56:7).

We invite musicians, artists, dancers and anyone with a similar passion for His presence to join with us]]></description>

House of Prayer Edmonton (HoPE) began as a vision by Jim Hall, Lead Pastor at the Canopy Christian Community in Edmonton. Jim had been impacted tremendously by the International House of Prayer (IHOP) in Kansas City and the teachings of Mike Bickle. After travelling to Kansas City to visit IHOP, God gave Jim a vision and a passion for 24 hour night and day prayer in Edmonton. 

Jim pastored at Central Baptist Church in Edmonton for 6 years before leaving to plant a new church with Eric Brooks called The Canopy Christian Community (taken from Isaiah 4:5-6). It was in the early days of The Canopy that Jim "put a stake in the ground" and began to contend for 24 hour prayer in Edmonton. The Canopy began praying once a month for a 24 hour period, incorporating IHOP inspired intercessory worship with an "urban monestary" format of prayer.

After a few years of praying 24 hours once per month at the Canopy, Jim moved House of Prayer under a city-wide banner. As an executive member of the Edmonton Evangelical Ministerial Association (EEMA), Jim brought House of Prayer under EEMAs spiritual covering. With a new name--House of Prayer Edmonton (HoPE)--Jim moved HoPEs monthly prayer times to a new location at Vanguard College in Edmonton. 

Vanguard College was becoming a hub of city-wide prayer with weekly Tuesday morning prayer meetings attended by pastors from across the city. Jim had become a regular attender of these meetings, hosted by Pastor Bob Gal. Bob had rented a portion of Vanguard College to establish The Meeting Place, a central location for prayer activities and prayer training. Jims relationship with Bob made Vanguard College a logical choice to host HoPE]]></description>

Scripture teaches that night-and-day prayer is crucial for the fullness of God?s power and purpose to be released (Lk. 18:7?8; Isa. 62:6?7).

The Maritime House of Prayer (MHOP) was birthed in the spring 
of 2006.  This occurred after eight years of carrying the vision 
but not having the full picture of how it would look and function 
in our region.  The vision is threefold:  the House of Prayer is to 
be a place of worship, intercession, and healing.  It will be an 
opportunity to connect with other followers of Jesus who have 
a passion to pray and seek the Lord for transformation in our 
cities. 

Mobile MHOP:

The unique aspect of MHOP is that it is a Mobile Maritime House 
of Prayer.  We believe that in many cities, towns, and villages of 
the Maritimes there will be a group of local people who will come 
together one day a month in their own city, town or village.  This 
"day" will be a date of the month that will be chosen by the core 
group and they will take responsibility for ensuring that this 
twenty-four hour period (midnight to midnight) of worship and 
intercession will take place in their location each month.  The 
physical location (building) may change monthly but the 
geographic location will be consistent]]></description>

Vision 

Our desire at the National House of Prayer is to mobilize informed, focused, and sustained prayer for Canada and its leaders.  

How we do this 

We attempt to do this by having an on-going presence of praying people in the halls of our Federal Government.  Intercesssors attend the daily Question Period, sit in Senate sessions, position themselves in Committee meetings and make appointments with individual Parliamentarians.  We intercede in the official Prayer Chapel, prayer-walk the grounds of Parliament Hill, visit the Supreme Court, and the Governor Generals residence and pray with Christians groups from the many different departments of national Government.

We also provide training in intercessory prayer for short-term prayer teams and long-term residents at our NHOP centre, and travel throughout Canada teaching our weekend Schools of Prayer, or week-long National Schools of Intercession.  Visiting teams are hosted for a week at a time at our very gracious facilities, just minutes east of Parliament Hill, while others sense the call to join our community for six month  or one year intensive experiences.

Because we believe in "informed intercession" we research and stay up-to-date with the current issues facing our leaders, and then provide this insight to thousands of intercessors through our regular email newsletters.  Networking with the many prayer movements in Canada is one of our greatest joys as we see coordinated prayer being released through city-wide prayer movements, new Provincial Houses of Prayer, and emerging leaders]]></description>

Prince George House of Prayer, opened officially October 2, 2005. It was a 10 year birthing process.

This is a place, where we hope you can come and quiet yourself and develop a deeper intimacy with God.

During the day, music is played and in this setting you can take extra time to wait on God and to listen for His voice. So often, we are busy doing a lot, even very good things....but maybe not the things that are on Gods heart. It takes a quieting of ourselves, putting aside distractions, and waiting. Jesus was our example of this. He did only the things He saw the Father doing. He met with His heavenly Father, spent many hours in prayer, and from that intimate union where He heard His Fathers voice in His heart...He did those things each day that were revealed to Him by His Father in His prayer times.

God is wanting us to become like Jesus. If Jesus needed to spend much time with the Father, how much more do we. Jesus loved spending time with Him. So often we think praying as a chore...so far, so far from how it really is meant to be...enjoying a loving relationship...interacting and sharing our hearts together like close friends]]></description>

Toronto House of Prayer embraces day and night live worship and prayer, intimacy with God, and preparing End Time messengers as the foundation for all that we do.

We believe this generation is looking for ?something? to give their life fully to; something to die for. That something is at the core of everyone, and only ?onething? can satisify; it?s the knowledge of the Man Christ Jesus. We are calling for a generation who will live for one thing just as David wrote:

One thing I have desired of the Lord that one thing I will seek, that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.

Our heart?s cry is to see a generation wholly given to God, a generation who will set themselves in worship, prayer and fasting for the second coming of our King. God is raising up a generation of messengers that embody His message. It is life in them, they carry it and they live it. They choose in this age to lay down their lives in prayer and fasting preparing the way for our Bridegroom King Jesus]]></description>

Casa de Oración - Pasión por Jesús, con Base Misionera en la ciudad de Copiapó Chile, nace ante la gran necesidad de tener una profunda búsqueda por enamorarse de Dios, de vivir apasionado por Jesús, de abrazar una vida de oración, ayuno y compasión por las naciones. Casa de Oración, es una comunidad cristiana que proporciona a cada creyente un espacio para pasar tiempos con Dios, escuchar su voz, experimentar su amor y libertad, un lugar de encuentros con el Amado, de contemplar y meditar en la belleza de Jesús. Afirmamos que Él, es el deseado de las naciones, el incomparable, Incontenible y Majestuoso Dios, la Tierra anhela ver la manifestación de su Gloria, por lo cual, como iglesia estamos comprometidos con dar a conocer a las naciones, el inmenso amor de Dios, a través de obras de justicias. ?Porque no podemos callar lo que hemos visto y oído?. (Hechos 4:20). Como base Misionera entrenamos e impulsamos a cada discípulo de Cristo, por medio de las escrituras y mediante el poder del Espíritu Santo, en abrazar una vida de oración y evangelismo profético, ejecutando en el día a día, obras de justicias. (Apocalipsis 19:7-8). Hoy más que nunca se puede sentir los pasos de nuestro Amado Jesús, en en su regreso por su iglesia, su regreso es inminente, el recuentro con su amada Iglesia esta pronto a suceder. Y es así como Dios esta trayendo una fresca revelación de un Dios Padre y un Dios Novio, moviendo a su amada iglesia a un nivel de conocimiento más profundo de Dios.Dios esta levantando una generación fascinada por la belleza de Jesús, que ha entendido que su primera razón de vivir y su deleite es pasar tiempos con Dios, de vivir maravillado de Aquel que nos amó como nadie en este mundo.
Jesús la Hermosura y Fragancia eterna. El Único que hace grandes maravillas. (Salmos 136:4]]></description>

<br/>
Eastbourne Prayer Centre is the home of Revival, a Christian media organisation spreading the Good News about Jesus Christ all around the world through radio programmes.

You do not have to look too far, nor too hard, to see that the vast majority of British people have all but lost any personal faith in the God of the Bible. The resulting collapse of moral standards in public and private life is made all the more painful by the evidence of a Church largely in retreat and Christian influence clearly in decline.
Whilst some strategies have succeeded in slowing the overall rate of decline (there are church groups and projects that have witnessed exciting development in recent years), the British population remains largely disinterested, having less and less exposure to the Gospel message. Eastbourne, where Revival is based, is no exception.
Despite its ever-growing population ï¿½ made up mainly of young families, the homeless, and refugees ï¿½ many have scarcely any church connections and remain untouched by the life-changing message of the Risen Christ. It is from this position of weakness ï¿½ coupled with the frustration of failure and the apparent hopelessness of the situation ï¿½ that it has become imperative that Godï¿½s people unite in seeking His mercy on an increasingly Godless society.
How can we hope to see the kind of spiritual awakening needed to turn the hearts of Britainï¿½s people back to God? It is a goal that cannot be achieved even with the finest of human strategies and effort. It is a work that only a gracious and merciful God can do ï¿½ ï¿½Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labour in vainï¿½ (Psalm 127:1).]]></description>

GHOP exists to exalt Jesus, pursue intimacy with God and contend for transformation through worship and intercession in the spirit of the tabernacle of David. We use the Harp & Bowl model of intercessory worship in regular Intercession, Worship with the Word and devotional meetings. GHOPs focus in intercession is on revival of the church and awakening in the nation Scotland, justice for the unborn and for those caught in modern day slavery, Israel and the Middle East, the Scottish and UK governments. Teaching sessions and occasional conferences focus on passion for Jesus, for the word of God, for prayer and for the Day of the Lord. Currently we meet three times a week, and were asking the Lord to set watchmen on the walls and raise up prophetic singers and musicians to keep the fire on the altar for extended times. We meet in St Georges Tron Church of Scotland, which is located on Buchanan Street, the busiest shopping street in Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland.]]></description>

Description
Once we have opened our hearts to modern sex slavery there is only one response: take action. As long as one person remains in slavery we are committed to fight it. We refuse to turn a blind eye to this injustice and will not allow it to continue on our watch. 

Exodus Cry (Exoduscry.com) has identified 10 key ways to take action against modern-day slavery which we pray will help you join with us in bringing an end to this injustice.

Pray ? "Thy Kingdom Come?. God has ordained His kingdom to operate in conjunction with human participation. He will avenge our cries and bring speedy justice when we cry out day and night for these women and children. Join us at our prayer watch on Friday afternoons from 1-4pm

Compassion ? Open your heart to the plight of the oppressed and allow ourselves to be moved by the things that move the heart of God

Stand in purity ? Lust fuels slavery. Abolition begins with a commitment to personal purity; otherwise we will find ourselves in partnership with the very spirit that keeps the sex trade booming. Make a purity covenant

Spread the word ? Become informed. Tell others in your sphere of influence about the realities of modern day slavery.

Volunteer - Be a servant. Offer your time, talents and passions to organisations in your community who serve victims of trafficking and prostitution

Watch ? Slavery thrives in shadows. Ask the Lord to shed light on the underworld of trafficking and give you eyes to see. You can play a vital role in keeping watch in your community.

Reach ? Touch one life. Women and children are being sexually exploited in just about every town and city on the earth. If you look for them you will find them. Whether it?s a women being sold on the street or dancing in a strip club get struggles and believe with them for full restoration that comes through Christ.

Speak up ? Be a voice for the voiceless. Let your voice be heard by contacting local politicians and community leaders about your concern for those victimised in the commercial sex trade. Petition them to implement the Swedish model of combating trafficking and prostitution ? download a copy here.

Adopt a child ? Who will father the fatherless? 90% of women in domestic prostitution were at one point in the foster care system. Trafficking is an exploitation of vulnerability. Adopting a child who is lost in the foster care system can prevent another young life from slipping into tentacles of forced prostitution and human trafficking.

Invest ? Sow into freedom. Join the abolitionists by giving financially to ministries who partner with the heart of Jesus to bring liberty to the captives and healing the broken]]></description>

<br/>
he Lord has called us to be a community of believers committed to God, each other, and to establishing a 24/7 house of prayer in London we gather daily for corporate prayer and worship in the spirit of the tabernacle of David. We are moving more and more into the direction of having night and day continues prayer and worship in London. 

At The International House of Prayer-London, we are committed to prayer, fasting, the Great Commission, and to living as forerunners, preparing the generation of The Lords return. We have a mandate to train believers to love Jesus and others wholeheartedly as together we go forth to preach the Word, heal the sick, serve the poor, and proclaim the return of Jesus across the earth.

Night and day prayer with worship is the spinal cord of everything else we do. We are inspired by Amos prophecy: On that day I will raise up The tabernacle of David , which has fallen down, And repair its damages; I will raise up its ruins, And rebuild it as in the days of old (Amos 9:11- NKJV//Acts 15:16 ). King David who received the revelation of night and day prayer and worship when He bought the Arc to Jerusalem and put it in a tabernacle, organized and paid 4,000 musicians and 288 singers to worship God 24/7 (I Chr.23:1-25:31).

Our vision is to prepare hundreds of full-time intercessory missionaries who, like John the Baptist, live a lifestyle of discipline and devotion to God. As forerunner messengers, their lives and voices cry out, Prepare the way of the Lord! We invite you to visit us online and in person. Join with us as we set our hearts to love God, worship Him alone, and dedicate our lives to serving Him without reservation; to demonstrate our love for others in works of service, justice, outreach, and compassion; and to proclaim the return of Jesus.]]></description>

<br/>
Who are we? We are a ministry organised by churchs in the South Coast central area functioning towards 24/7 house of prayer, serving as a missions base. 

Whats the VISION of SCCHOP? Establish individuals into the bridal identity through 24/7 prayer as forerunners in this end time. To release Gods power and love in the earth. 

Whats the MISSION of SCCHOP? We exist to reach the lost and to restore the identity of believers to Christ in the context of the Bridal Paradigm. By providing biblical-based education for believers of Christ in all areas of life and to raise them up as intimate lovers of God. For the releasing of labourers empowered by the Holy Spirit through 24/7 night and day prayer for the great end time harvest of souls. 

What is the purpose SCCHOP Missions? The Missions Base exists to call forth and train forerunners to embrace the prophetic forerunner spirit leading to a fasted lifestyle and the proclamation of the beauty of God as Bridegroom, King and Judge to equip believers to embrace Jesus in a wholehearted way at the end of the Age. Is this a new idea? No, definitely not! In fact the, perpetual solemn assemblies have played a key part in the formation of the church down through the centuries. For example: Around 1000 BC, King David established a tabernacle in Jerusalem and set a precedent of night and day worship before the Lord that continued at various times throughout Israel and Judahs history. Each time this order of worship was reintroduced, spiritual breakthrough, deliverance and military victory followed. Likewise, throughout the centuries, groups in Ireland, Germany, South Korea, and elsewhere across the globe have established day and night centers of prayer and worship. Following in this tradition, the South Coast Central House of Prayer are working towards their own night and day prayer to build their goal of 24/7 worship.]]></description>

<br/>
Taunton House of Prayer exists to serve the church in Taunton and the surrounding area. We gather during the week to pray and intercede both for our town and the nations.

A Prayer Room  Why?

God is raising up a people to go and do likewise, to be like Jesus in this world: to love with His heart, to speak with His words, to see through His eyes and to walk in His power.

The rulers and elders in Acts 4:13 saw ordinary fishermen walking in boldness, power and miracles and it says they took note that these men had been with Jesus. The power of our lives is in knowing and being with God. Dan 11:32 says the people who know their God shall prove themselves strong and shall stand firm and do exploits for God.

We are running a prayer room as a place of encouragement to the church to come and be with God. It is a place for any of us to come whenever and for as long as we like to read the Bible, talk to God in prayer and worship God for who He is because we want to know Him]]></description>

24-7 Prayer is an international, interdenominational movement of prayer, mission and justice that began with a single, student-led prayer vigil in Chichester, England in 1999 and has spread, by word-of-mouth, into 100+ nations.
For more than a decade the global 24-7 Prayer meeting has continuedunbroken, impacting locations as diverse as the US Naval Academy, a German punk festival, war-zones and underground churches, the slums of Delhi, the jungles of Papua New Guinea, ancient English cathedrals and even a brewery in Missouri.
Along the way, this unusual prayer meeting has given rise to numerous new initiatives, communities and ministries particularly focusing on the poor, the marginalised, students and those outside the reach of normal expressions of church]]></description>

As we fulfill the command to intercede for all who are in authority we will actually have within our sights, the Knesset and Supreme Court of Israel. We have also designed an upper room to seat 120.

Visione

La casa di preghiera 24/7 Italia è un luogo dedicato alla preghiera, all?intercessione, alla lode e all?adorazione, in cui ogni attività, esperienza o progetto vuole essere incentrata su Dio e sulla realtà della Sua presenza.
È uno spazio aperto a chiunque abbia il desiderio di dedicare qualche ora o qualche giorno del proprio tempo in preghiera, intercessione, lode e adorazione.
È uno sp...azio predisposto appositamente per:
- dedicare del tempo allesercizio di discipline spirituali come il digiuno e la meditazione della Parola
- trascorrere momenti di intimità alla presenza di Dio
- esprimere e sviluppare talenti e doni spirituali e artistici, in un ambiente sperimentale, spontaneo e dispirazione divina.

L?obiettivo è anche quello di coordinare insieme alle chiese locali, ai ministeri e a credenti singoli d?Italia, una rete di preghiera nazionale con lo scopo finale di stabilire nel nostro Paese un flusso ininterrotto di preghiera, lode e intercessione, 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7.
Crediamo sia importante continuare a stabilire e consolidare contatti con movimenti analoghi allestero già esistenti.


Attività

Sessioni di intercessione, lode, adorazione.
Giornate dedicate alla preghiera continua per motivi specifici.
Seminari, studi biblici, corsi di preparazione artistica e ministeriale con ospiti nazionali e internazionali.
Coordinazione e organizzazione di una rete nazionale di preghiera 24/7.


24/7

Il modello della preghiera 24/7 si ispira al tabernacolo di Davide, un luogo in cui per 40 anni leviti, cantori e adoratori offrirono preghiera e lode continua alla presenza di Dio. In questa tenda dimorava la presenza manifesta di Dio e veniva custodita l?Arca del Patto (1 Cronache 16).
Nelle Scritture Dio ribadisce più volte il Suo proposito di ricostruire il tabernacolo di Davide (Atti 15:16-18 ? Amos 9:11), non già la struttura fisica ma piuttosto un ministero di preghiera e adorazione continua alla Sua presenza.
Vediamo anche che nella Sala del Trono al cospetto di Dio, si offre l?incenso che rappresenta le preghiere dei santi, insieme al suono dell?arpa; qui si ripete il modello del tabernacolo di Davide: preghiera e intercessione, unite al canto e alla musica.
Un altro esempio è visibile nel tabernacolo di Mosé, dove i sacerdoti avevano il compito di bruciare continuamente l?incenso e ravvivare il fuoco acceso da Dio sull?altare (Levitico 6:12-13 ? Esodo 30:8) Naturalmente, questo è un modello che sicuramente riguarda la vita del credente individuale, ma è anche un?ulteriore conferma del fatto che Dio desidera che ci sia questa continuità nella lode e nella preghiera, a livello personale e a livello comunitario.

It is our desire that of the place of intimacy in worshiping God, that we will encounter and partner with Him through prayer and intercession according to the desires of His heart and His Word.
As we worship and pray, we grow in knowing the heart of our loving Father so that we are equipped, overflowing with His love and compassion to go out and minister to the people around us according to the gifts that God has given us and according to the place of ministry He has placed us to be.]]></description>

The primary purpose of the Malta House of Prayer is to be a people that prioritize beholding the Lord in His beauty and being renewed into His likeness every day.
(Psalm 27:4)
We are a community that desires to be a continual furnace of intercession, a gathering of watchmen who have devoted themselves to a lifestyle of prayer and fasting.
(Isaiah 52:8, Isaiah 62:6,7)

 




One of the main visions of the Malta House of Prayer is to meet daily to pray and worship and experience the power of the Holy Spirit. We do this mostly in the style of the Tabernacle of David. (1 Chron 23-26 ) We desire to bring unity to the churches by facilitating these prayer meetings as a neutral environment, a place where individuals from all denominations are welcome to come and worship corporately. (Acts 2:46,47)
 
The main topic of intercession during the prayer meetings is the Body of Christ in Malta. We serve the Body in this way by lifting up the congregations and the leaders daily before Jesus. We also continually petition the Lord to bring a great spiritual awakening to Malta and the surrounding nations.

 


We encourage participants to take what they gain in the prayer meetings back to their various communities and places of fellowship. We welcome members of local churches to be a part of the Service Team by leading prayer and worship during the meetings as an expression of continual partnership within the Body of Christ in Malta. While prioritizing relational accountability within the Leadership Team we also encourage them to serve, pray, and worship with other groups. We purposely have not scheduled a Sunday morning meeting so as to make this easy. As a way of serving the churches in Malta, we facilitate daily prayer meetings in hopes of contributing to unity and overall spiritual maturity of the Body of Christ.
 
We are also more than a local community because we partner internationally with organizations who have prioritized prayer as part of their ministry. The Lord has clearly orchestrated this and we will continue to serve through international partnerships to fulfill the Lords purposes in the Mediterranean region. The Lord has spoken numerous times to us and to many others that Malta is very strategic in His plan for the regio]]></description>

24-7 Prayer Ermelo
Entering the Lord God

Many of us desire, but what is in practice often. It seems so ambitious. One hour alone (or with someone else) pray. How to play it ready? And still others form a chain of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? Come on!

May we invite you to insert a first step and just want to get one hour? Not with the obligation to one hour a serious attitude of prayer to sit, but also to take time to read a passage, think about it, to a good CD to listen own music making (with the available guitar ) and sing your heart out in song. Everything is possible, especially in the area, which is specially decorated. The prayers of your heart you loud or soft to the Lord speak, but it is also possible to them as encouragement for others to write (in a notebook, or even on the blackboard).

Come and convince yours]]></description>

Vision and purpose
There are no translations available.

In the house of prayer is the central theme of the first part of the prayer that Jesus taught us:
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven" (Matthew 6:9,10).
 
There are three objectives:
 
1) It is a place of worship where the Bible, the word of God in proclamation, music and singing prayers to Him is returned, and being created in His creation. Once this took place in the tabernacle of David, and
will again take place in the last days (1 Chronicles 9:11 16/Amos / Acts 15:16-18). The desire is that there will be an evolution to 24 / 7 prayer:
"Day and night they repeat:" Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, who is and who is ... " (Revelation 4:8 vice vers]]></description>

The past ten or fifteen years have been all over the world, including the Netherlands, House of Prayer arise. Elim may be one of them.

Elim Rotterdam from 1901 to 1940 was already a mission home for Jews. It was located in the same place as where Elim is now. See History. Elim in 2005, reopened its doors as a House of Prayer.

The Bible is the foundation of everything in Elim. See also History and Vision.

Prayer is of course the main activity in Elim. There are several prayer meetings. We pray first for salvation of the inhabitants of large-Rotterdam, about one million people. Furthermore we pray for all practical matters of Church and Society in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Because the blessing of the biblical people of Israel the second pillar of Elim, there are of course Isra?lbidstonden.

With the famous "pray and work" in mind there are two practical ministries in Elim, which is actually the blessing of Israel and Evangelism.

An example of the first is sufficient interest we hold monthly Messianic Shabbat meal. With the aim of interested acquainted with one of Gods Biblical Holidays and to taste how the people of Israel celebrates an evening.

Elim is not affiliated with any local church or church but works to serve the Church of Jesus Christ in Rotterdam. The people who come to pray in Elim (including preachers and pastors) come from many different church]]></description>

The House of Prayer is a foundation - founded on May 14, 2003 - Christians from various backgrounds who want to encourage personal and collective to persevere in prayer.

"n January 2006, young adults began meeting together daily, marking the beginning of prayer gatherings that still continue to this day. The Prayer Room is the essence of who we are as a people; its the heartbeat of all that we are called to do. We believe that offering Jesus unrelenting adoration is something He is truly worthy of. Scripture also tells us that night and day prayer is crucial if a city wants to experience awakening. We long for the Prayer Room to be a place of encounter, of personal transformation, and training in the Word of God. We desire that it would be a place where hearts are set free, bodies are healed, and where we gather to contend for the fullness of God in our community."]]></description>

"Our desire is that the message of 24/7 prayer would impact the Romanian Nation so that more and more Christians would get to experience deeper levels of intimacy with Christ. Thus, we long for the context where the cultivating of this intimacy would be facilitated, all this resulting in the effective development of a Christlike character within men. Our heart burns for the training, equipping and the support of the saints so that they might have an impact in our society due to a life devoted to prayer and fasting."]]></description>

This House of Prayer is located in the "belly" of Russia. 
As said in John 7:3, "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." We pray for Russia to believe in Christ as its Savior and for all the Nations to get to know the Lord. 
Our prayer meetings are conducted almost daily and include Intersession, Worship with the Word and Devotional sets. 
If you are in Ekaterinburg, you are more then welcome to come and join us in prayer and worship.]]></description>

<br/>
At the International House of Prayer ? One Thing Ministries, the Lord has called us to be a Forerunner Community that is committed to Prayer with Worship, the Prophetic and the Great Commission.

As a Forerunner Community, we embrace and seek to live out the following four heart standards (embodied in the acronym ?IHOP?), in order to be a people who will partner with God in these Last Days:

    Intercession: a people of prayer, expressed corporately through night and day prayer and worship;

    Holiness: a people who have set themselves apart for intimacy with God, and who live out the Sermon on the Mount lifestyle;

    Offering: a people who give extravagantly to God for the advancement of His Kingdom, and who live a fasted life (ie. simply) for themselves;

    Prophetic: a people who stand boldly in faith, move in the power of God and have confidence in His provision, protection and direction.

As a missions base, we seek to equip and send missionaries as dedicated intercessors and evangelists with a forerunner spirit who will labour to see revival and a great harvest all over Asia.

The heart of our missions base is 24/7 worship and prayer; thus, we seek to establish a 24/7 House of Prayer in Singapore ? a perpetual and sacred assembly gathering corporately to fast and pray in the spirit of the Tabernacle of David.

Two historical figures from the Bible who inspire us are Anna, the first evangelist and forerunner in the New Testament, and King David from the Old Testament. Anna prayed and fasted for over sixty years before Jesus? first coming (Luke 2:37), and King David organized and paid 4,000 musicians and 288 singers to worship God night and day (1 Chron. 23:1 ? 25:31).

Our mandate is to train believers, from this place of night and day prayer, to love Jesus and people wholeheartedly as they go forth to preach the Word, heal the sick, serve the poor, plant Houses of Prayer and proclaim the return of Jesus across the earth.]]></description>

Stockholm House of Prayer is an interdenominational prayer movement with Jesus in the center. We work in relationship with the larger Body of Christ for renewal, revival and seek to walk out the two great commandments to love God and people.

Through prayer, worship and the Word we seek to create a platform where we can meet God and in His presence be healed, transformed and restored. We do not want to build a local church, but instead be a resource for the Body of Christ in Stockholm, Sweden. We seek to build a house of prayer in Stockholm, with ongoing prayer and worship 24-7.

We meet to pray and worship (intercession) every Monday at 7 pm in the basement of the Rosenius church (entrance to the left of Rosenius Church), Smala Gr?nd 5, Stockholm. Intercession sessions can be more energetic, as the room is invited to engage in corporate prayer. There is generally a specific prayer focus, and individuals in the room are welcome to pray on the microphone for a corporate burden. There are also times of small group prayer for any who wish to participate.

Every Wednesday we meet at 7.00 pm for contemplative worship. Contemplative worship is a prayer format in which we agree with God?s heart as we sing the biblical truths of who God is and what His promises are. These sessions are more devotional in nature, providing an atmosphere conducive to reading the Bible and entering into contemplative or devotional prayer.

We also meet every first friday of the month at 7 pm for renewal meetings or biblestudies.

Glasgow House of Prayer (GHOP) is a non-denominational ministry that exists to pursue intimacy with God, exalt Jesus and contend for transformation through night and day worship and intercession in the spirit of the tabernacle of David. We are currently training musicians, singers, prayer leaders and technical support, forming teams to facilitate regular gatherings for prayer and worship around the city. While 24/7 isnt the finish line, Jesus is more than worthy of unceasing devotion and unbroken exaltation. As Christians we are called into partnership with God through persevering intercession, in agreement with His heart and word, and in unity with one another. The promises of 2 Chronicles 7:14 will be realised only if we fulfill the conditions - "if My people who are called by My Name, will humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways and seek My face, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and will heal the land."

A Vision of Birminghams Future Rooted in the Past
Three essential materials for the making of iron and steel lay beneath the ridges and valleys of what became Birmingham, Alabama. Iron Ore gave Red Mountain overlooking the city its name. White limestone was used to take impurities out of the iron ore. Black coal fueled molten furnaces night and day. No where else in the Western Hemisphere were these three raw materials found concentrated so highly together. A nations hunger for steel fueled the dramatic post-Civil War birth and growth of Birmingham out of Jones Valley. Birmingham was forged in the place of fire.
Like the iron ore, limestone, and coal itself, Red Native American, White European, and Black African descendants lived in Birminghams valleys and prayed from her mountain tops. The poor from around world labored deep beneath the earth to dig out the elements that would help build a city and a nation.
But deeply rooted greed, injustice, racial and religious bigotry, violence, and political corruption also stained the land, the atmosphere, and the people as the city grew. Even before the birth of the city, the Creek Indian Nations back had been broken in the bloodiest battle ever fought between Indians and the United States Army at Alabamas Horseshoe Bend in 1814. The land called Alabama today still grieves the broken covenants, violence, and horrible forced removals of Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole nations to Oklahoma in the 1830s. For those with ears to hear, the voices of injustice still cry out beneath our feet.
Jim Crow segregation laws, a.k.a. legal apartheid, divided whites and blacks for decades on end. A Methodist minister murdered a Catholic Priest in broad daylight on the rectory porch of St. Pauls Cathedral for marrying his daughter to a Puerto Rican man in 1921. He was easily acquitted in court. Rich "Big Mule" industrialists murdered those trying to organize mine workers crying out because of the oppressive conditions in 1935.
In 1963, the Civil Rights movement came to Birmingham and the world watched in horror as Birmingham firemen blasted Black youth demonstrators with high powered fire hoses. Policemen let German Shepherd dogs rip at the clothes of other marchers. But the national tide of racial hatred turned toward healing through those images from the streets of Birmingham.
It has been a long march toward justice and righteousness in our city. The inspiration for lasting change has always come through the prayers and courageous actions of Gods people through prophetic messengers of His Kingdom.
Now in a new millennium, a new generation is on the march in Birmingham. We believe something about the destiny still before us as the people of God in this city. God is once again placing His burning heart in ours for radical personal and city-wide transformation under the leadership of Jesus. Birmingham still holds a key to a wellspring of justice and racial healing that will flow out of the Southside of America from the Beautiful Gate of Alabama into the nations.
The Birmingham Prayer Furnace is not a place. It is a revolution of revelation in the heart of the Bride of Jesus Christ through night and day city-wide prayer and worship. What we as a city need most is not another ministry or industry or institution. We need the very burning presence of God dwelling in our midst 24-7. He need Him. We need His vision of our true identity as His People in His City serving His Purpose.
Birmingham was forged in fire from the Earth, but her destiny is to be governed by a Man of Fire from Heaven. The largest cast iron statue in the world stands on the high ground of Red Mountain over Birmingham today. Vulcan, the Roman god of the forge, was crafted as a symbol of the citys steel making pride for the 1904 St. Louis Worlds Fair. As he points to the sky today, Vulcan is a constant reminder to Birmingham that the Bridegroom King of Heaven and Judge of all the Earth is coming soon. Some believe Jesus will stand on Red Mountain and evaluate this city.
The Sloss Furnaces stand in the valley below. This historical landmark is a relic of the economic engine of the past. Today it is the health care and research industry that pulls the city economy. But only a five iron golf shot away from the Sloss Furnace is another place called The Furnace. This is a gentlemens club, a.k.a. a strip club. It is legal in our city for men to burn with lust as they gaze on naked dancing women.
The Birmingham Prayer Furnace is a place where Jesus can gaze on the burning heart of His Bride in our city. It is a place where people of every color can catch a glimpse of the Burning Man of Heaven as He gazes back at us. Jesus declared that His Fathers House was to be a House of Prayer for all Nations. Let it be so in the Heart of Old Dixie. Let the south winds blow on the garden of Americas heart awakening love for Jesus, the Fairest of All.
May the Holy Spirit forge a wedding band of pure gold refined in the fire of a never dying furnace of worship and prayer in Birmingham that leads to a city burning with bright righteousness. The Day of Jesus return is near. May He put steel in our longing for Him such that His Bride in this city will "watch and pray, love justice, and preach His Kingdom" all the more as darkness increases. May we humble ourselves, seek His face, and turn from our wicked ways, that He might hear from heaven, forgive our sin, heal our land, and say "Well done Birmingham!" when He stands on Red Mountain as the King of all!

Calvary Fellowship currently meets 14 times a week for prayer and worship. We meet morning and night every day of the week and at noon on weekdays. It is our desire to see prayer and worship established in the Shoals area of Alabama 24 hours a day, every day. Most of our prayer meetings are centered on a desire to see God move powerfully, by His Spirit, in the Shoals area. On Wednesday nights we pray for the world and for world outreach ministries. All nighttime meetings have a worship team present and are Tabernacle of David type meetings. All believers in the Northwest Alabama area are invited to come and participate.]]></description>

We gather on Friday nights for a time of live Worship and Prayer. Sunday evenings we meet in a bible study setting to go deep in the Word.
Description
Gulf Coast House of Prayer is not a building but a company of intercessors gathering weekly to see the spiritual atmosphere of Escambia, Baldwin and Mobile County changed through Prayer and Fasting!

It is also a network of Gulf Coast Intercessors with like Vision crying out for Gods purposes to be released in our region. As Intercessors we need to be connected and united in prayer to see the fullness of Gods Glory manifest in our region.

This page can be used to post prayer requests and to inform intercessors of events and prayer meetings taking place throughout our cities. 

God is raising up Intercessors all across the globe, He is calling the Church back to the place of prayer where the Church was originally birthed; the upper room in Jerusalem. There is a Joel 2 call going forth across this Nation to return to the Lord with our whole hearts, in prayer with fasting, weeping and mourning. We must rend our hearts, take up our cross and give ourselves to His purposes in our generation. We must set aside our agenda and give ourselves to His. 

We must get a higher Vision of God. Let us come together in the place of Prayer, remind ourselves of His promises and lets partner with Him in Intercession to see them come to pass. God send Revival to the Gulf Coast]]></description>

Storehouse || Vision
The Storehouse, a prayer ministry of Asbury, is a place to experience intimacy with God by combining live worship with prayer. The prayer room provides an atmosphere for all people to enjoy prayer by being refreshed by the presence of the Holy Spirit: through community growing deeper in our walk with Jesus, leading us into powerful missional lives.

:: Day and night || Continual Prayer

We are experiencing day and night prayer and worship initiated through believers who cry out to the Lord through music, arts, creativity, prophetic word, and prayer. Together we seek the face of Jesus, ministering to the heart of God, yearning for the powerful anointing of the Holy Spirit. Luke 18.7

:: Community || United Prayer

We are experiencing the heart cry of Jesus to become unified in community, coming together as one body of Christ, regardless of denomination or Christian church affiliation. ?That all of them may be one, Father, just as You are in Me and I am in You.? As we laugh, worship, pray, and share life together in an atmosphere of joy and prayer, God is glorified. John 17.21-23

:: Fresh Outpouring || Missional Prayer

We are experiencing God?s presence through prayer and worship in the prayer room leading to and increase in prayer and mission in our homes and lives.  We minister and intercede for one another and for all those in need of prayer, we are sent out in the fullness of the Holy Spirit to impact the world for Jesus Christ.  Numbers 11.16-1]]></description>

Our desire is to raise up houses of prayer throughout our regions in homes and in churches and place of gathering. The Lord spoke the word to us to make My House a House of Prayer for all Nations. It is our goal to have 24x7 worship and prayer burning from Healing The Nations International Church which is the location of our base for the House of Prayer. It is the highest point in the region.

PRAYER
 
We believe we are called to deep, joyful and rewarding partnership with God in the place of prayer. The human spirit was designed to commune with God in amazing and profound ways. We labor strategically in this glory and partnership contending for Power, Healing, Salvation and Breakthrough of Revival. Partnership in prayer is central to how the Kingdom of God touches the earth and critical to our identity as the church.
 
Isaiah 56:7
OUTREACH
 
We desire to make real, consistant and positive impact in the local community around us. We love our neighbors and the body of Christ in this region and long to serve them with compassion and sincere love and continually invite them to the great purposes that God has for all of us together.
 
Matthew 28:18-19
 
This is why we also partner and serve along other ministries and outreaches in our area. We pray and then go serve and support the proven ministries in our region who are evangelizing, discipling and washing the feet of the unwanted.
 
Along with this we go into our local community and serve our neighborhoods with mercy deeds, compassion ministry and prayer and evangelism]]></description>

We believe and cry out to God, ?You are worthy of unending worship and prayer in Central Arkansas and throughout the earth.? May it be on earth as it is in heaven]]></description>

About EVHOP			
 
What is the East Valley House of Prayer? It is a modern-day Holy of Holies where we minister before the Lord: lifting up praise, exalting His name, seeking His face, and interceding for the generations.
 
 
A place to come into God?s presence as we step out of this busy world and into a space dedicated to intimacy with our Creator
A place to intercede for God?s Kingdom to touch the nations and transform lives
A place for the hurting, the sick, the addicted, and the lost to come for healing, freedom, and life in Christ
A place where God?s people are discipled and equipped to reach the world
 
We live in turbulent times. We live in a world filled with hurting and broken people. We need God to heal our land. This is why the East Valley House of Prayer (EVHOP) is critically important to our state, our nation, our world, and to you.
 
EVHOP transcends denominational and generational lines as it focuses on the universal calling to pray. Currently, we have prayer gatherings at EVHOP 6-days a week as we strive to mobilize the required resources to establish 24/7 prayer in Arizona year-round]]></description>

Deborah is passionate about mobilizing and equipping the Body of Christ to engage in an intimate, fiery relationship with the Lord. In 2005 she felt the call of the Lord to become a "fire starter" and serve to help others ignite a passion for Jesus through day and night worship and prayer. Lite the Fire was launched in early 2006. She has written articles and training materials, speaks at conferences and has lead prayer teams to pray onsite locally, nationally and internationally. Currently, she and the team at Lite the Fire are spearheading "The Torch", a prayer initiative which was launched in 2008 to mobilize non-stop worship and prayer throughout the state of Arizona. Deborah also serves as the Arizona State Director for SPAN (Strategic Prayer Action Network), a global network lead by Becca Greenwood, Christian Harvest Internationa]]></description>

As the temple of God, we are called to make our own hearts and the world around us a dwelling place for God. We are committed to walking this out in a tangible way through a constant lifestyle of prayer and fasting. The model of a 24 hour house of prayer makes such a lifestyle possible.

Since 1999 we have been contending for a 24 hour house of prayer to be established in Arizona in which constant prayer and worship is offered to God. In this the church becomes the ?house of prayer? being vessels to bring forth God?s will and kingdom in our own lives, the state, and the nation.

Each small group takes their ?watch on the wall? each month by leading the prayer meeting. Even the children take a turn leading prayer. See the calendar to find out what week each small group is leading]]></description>

PWI started with a vision given to Pastor Bjørn Pedersen on April 27, 1986, in Alexandria, Minnesota, USA. The ministry was formally organized in the fall of 1995 in Glendale/Phoenix, Arizona.
 
It has grown into a dynamic and unique ministry with a variety of prayer activities, events and strategies, such as prayer explosions, prayer vigils and watches, prayer requests processed through the Internet, many different prayer teaching seminars such as prayer schools and leadership training seminars with an emphasis on prayer, prayer outreaches like prayer journeys, expeditions, missions, prayer cruises, prayer conferences, prayer resources (some of them have been translated into several other languages), and more.
 
PWI emphasizes praying for others, encouraging Christians to pray intentionally, and teaching prayer, especially through the Prayer Schools. At the present time, PWI is offering five different Prayer Schools varying in length from five to fifteen days. Two additional Prayer Schools are under construction. PWI Prayer Schools have already been offered in Africa, Asia, America, and Europe. The Regular Prayer School Program is primarily training leaders. The Weekly Prayer School Program is targeting the ?grass-roots? with the message of prayer, usually taught by local instructors after receiving training through PWI.
 
The materials are powerful, the methods effective, and communication with the groups inspirational, resulting in phenomenal responses. One of the most frequent comments to participation in a PWI Prayer School is it was a life-changing experience]]></description>

about us

What is a "House of Prayer"? 
Check out the FAQs at the International House of Prayer website.
 
Who/What is WMHOP?
 
The White Mountain House of Prayer is NOT  a "church" but rather a group of individuals  from  many  different Christian fellowships who have a common belief in the power of God through personal and community prayer. We are dedicated to :
 
Expanding Prayer, Praise, and Worship in the White Mountains
 
The God we serve and love is worthy of the praise and adoration of every heart in the White Mountains!  We long to see prayer, praise and worship expand exponentially both in quantity and depth. It is prayer that leads to increased faith and joy!

Our vision is to see a COMMUNITY that is in love with God and one another - rise up together to see Jesus exalted and broadcast through every possible platform into the nations of the earth.]]></description>

About
RaiseAmerica is envisioned for a another Jesus Movement; raising the Light of the glory of God in the face of Christ in America and in the nations.
Mission
It is our mission to combat iniquity, awaken righteousness and release the light of Jesus in America and the nations through inspiring Christ centered houses and communities of prayer and worship; reaching the next generation with the gospel of the Son of God; sending transformation teams and individuals equipped in prayer, power and proclamation; broadcasting the plumb line of righteousness and justice; and, networking with others toward this same mission.
Description
We see America standing at the CROSSroads of awakening and reformation. A new JESUS Movement is dawning upon the nation; a Jesus Movement, not like the last one, but like the first one. As in the Book of Acts, a Jesus Movement is coming and will be as it was then; the inception of a historic wave of prayer and missions to transform cities and nations]]></description>

The  Prayer  Room  exists to  see  people  come  into  personal  revival,  to  see the cities  in  our  region  experience  a  great  outpouring,  and  to  take  part  in  the  global impact  of  the  release  of  the  presence  and  power  of  God  in  our  nation. The Prayer Room has been designed to reflect the tabernacle of David (1 Chr. 22-24); it is designed to be a place where we never cease worshiping the Lord and interceding for our world.

We want you to feel comfortable, whether as a participant or as a visitor. You are welcome to stay in the Prayer Room as long as you like during our current Hours of operation. While in the Prayer Room, feel free to pray, sing along with the worship teams,read your Bible, study a favorite commentary, or write in your journal. You may sit, stand, or even pace up and down the aisles. Whatever you do, we simply ask that you do it in a manner that honors and serves the other people in the room.
We extend a VERY warm welcome to you, our visitor!

The Prayer room will be open during the posted times on our schedule. If you have a need while in the Prayer Room feel free to visit one of our administrative staff, located in the lobby and they will be happy to assist you.

 Types of Sets in the Prayer Room   
? Intercession ? This is a time of corporate worship and prayer. There is generally a specific prayer focus, and individuals in the room are welcome to pray on the microphone for a corporate burden which may involve the Fremont region or believers worldwide. There are also cycles of ?rapid fire prayer? where, one by one, people pray 15-second prayers on a specific theme in succession, as well as times of small group prayer and ministry time for those who wish to participate.

? Worship with the Word ? This prayer format is one in which we agree with God?s heart as we sing the biblical truths of who God is and what His promises are. These sessions are more devotional in nature, providing an atmosphere conducive to reading the Bible and entering into contemplative or devotional prayer.

? Devotional -  This prayer format focuses on creating an anointed atmosphere in the Prayer Room for individuals to commune with God in meditation upon Scripture and soaking in His Presence.]]></description>

Here at the Desert House of Prayer we come together in the Spirit of 
Intercession to engage with God. To break into the heavens through 
prophetic intercession and worship.

-Ephesians 3:10 To the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God 
might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers 
in the heavenly places.

Our goal is to raise up burning and shining lamps that we would be 
wise virgins, having our lamps trimmed and ready for the coming of 
the Lord. (Matt 25: 1-13]]></description>

The Justice House Of Prayer San Diego (JHOPSD) exists to raise up a house of prayer in Southern California that contends with every other house that challenges the Lordship and supremacy of Christ over all affairs. We recognize that there are ungodly, growing faiths, which have a prayer culture, and it is time for the Bride of Christ to move from having prayer meetings and become a people who never cease to make intercession before the throne of grace. "And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?" Luke 18:7<br /><br />
JHOPSD is a daughter of Justice House Of Prayer, located in Washington, DC. JHOP was birthed out of TheCall prayer assemblies, which saw massive amounts of young and old assemble together for solemn assemblies in the spirit of Joel 2:15-17. JHOP is a covenant community of young and old who seek to lift a continuous (24/7) cry of worship and intercession for and out of our nations capitol]]></description>

In the Fall of 2010, as a student at UC Berkeley, David Kim felt the urgency of the Lord upon his heart to establish 24/7 prayer on his campus. He felt the Lord open up a specific passage from His Word, 1 Kings 18, in which Elijah, in the face of the darkness of his land, rebuilds an altar to the Lord and makes intercession for his people. In a similar way, David felt the mandate to rebuild the ?altar? of prayer upon his campus, wherein the ?fire would not go out? (Leviticus 6:12) in worship and intercession to the One True God. In the coming weeks, the desires and impressions upon his heart were confirmed through a series of powerful events, and from these, not only he, but a generation of students were stirred and mobilized to establish the ?altar? of prayer upon their campus. Coupled with a 40 day fast, God birthed within the Christian students at Berkeley a movement in the blueprint of 24/7 prayer.
Meanwhile, across the globe in South Korea, Joseph Kim and his wife, Grace, were seeking the face of the Lord.  They both, separately and individually, felt a strong burden from the Lord to return home to Berkeley and establish a house of worship and prayer, according to John 17:20-24, Psalm 27:4-8, and Acts 15:16-18.  Through these Scriptures, they felt the Lord speaking to them about what it means to ?love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.?  That to love the Lord is to die and live to fulfill His desires, just as King David did and was a called  ?man after God?s own heart.?  It was King David who prayed (Psalm 27:4) Jesus? prayer (John 17:24) one thousand years before Jesus came to the earth as a man.  Joseph and Grace felt led by the Lord to establish a house of worship and prayer according to the Tabernacle of David, and see the promise of Acts 15:16-18 in its fullness.
As Joseph returned from Korea to walk in fulfillment of the burden he felt, he was divinely introduced to the burgeoning student prayer movement that was already being birthed in Berkeley. As leaders from the student prayer movement and Joseph met, they felt unanimously that building a house of worship and prayer in accordance with the desires of the Lord was a work that they should undertake together. Since then, they have set their faces in one mind and one spirit to see the desire of the Lord fulfilled: to be one with Him and behold Him forever by establishing a night and day house of worship and prayer for all nations]]></description>

We are house of prayer which initiated out of a local church. We have over 60 hours of prayer during the week in both Spanish and English. As of now, our site is run through the chuch website. We will have a website up and running within weeks.

Our desires to not call teens and young adults to the house of prayer, but disciple them and equip into the house of prayer. We have then formed a Forerunner Academy which as of now is for high school students.]]></description>

The Lord has placed a challenge before this ministry: "to release a REFORMATION that will be read about all around the world" (Cindy Jacobs @ Azusa Street, 8/21). God is calling a generation to rise up in boldness in this hour--to go outside the four walls of the Church to "Contend for Heaven on Earth" through relentless worship and intercession. He is calling an army to lay down their time, their agendas, their reputations, and ultimately their lives for the sake of the Gospel. Those who hear this call will be used to usher in the last great move of the Holy Spirit upon the Earth (Matthew 24:14).]]></description>

What are the Regional Sacred Assemblies?
In a nut shell, and with your help and participation, these Regional Sacred Assemblies are like The Call, only smaller, semi-annually/quarterly, held in multiple regions of California, and with a few other twists. So basically 12-hours of prayer, fasting, worship, declaration, art, mini-preach and open mike in a very spontaneous format. They will eventually take place continuously in 8-City/Regions of California, from San Diego to Chico/Redding. These regions will then converge once a year into a larger Sacred Assembly that rotates throughout the State]]></description>

Located in a historic church building in the small town of Nipomo, we are a contending house of prayer begun in 2015. We are contending for revival, for justice, and for transformation. Undergirding all of our intercessory prayer is our belief that the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is available to us today, and is still bringing what is dead back to life. We believe this for those who are dead in their sins, but also for dead hopes, dead marriages, dead churches, and more.

Because we believe in a God who created us for intimate fellowship with Him, we also want to provide a sanctuary ? a safe place for people to find rest, peace, joy, healing, and refreshing as well as encouragement to pursue God?s presence. Our devotional sets, and especially what we call our ?prayer chapel hours? are geared towards that.]]></description>

In the summer of 2011, God established the Santa Barbara House of Prayer  through the vision of Jacob and Kimberly Reeve with the colaboration of many  dear friends. The mission was to create a place in the heart of Santa Barbara  where people could encounter God 7 days a week through prayer, worship, and the operation of the Holy Spirit. Since then, God has quickly established  us as a spiritual epicenter of God?s presence in Downtown Santa Barbara. Even more glorious, He has made us as a family of faith, deeply united in  genuine love for each other.  

SBHOP functions as a synagogue, not only hosting daily prayer and worship, but also hosting transformative classes and ministries that cover a variety of  subjects. Our doors are open most of the week to the thousands of people who come to downtown Santa Barbara. With our well equiped interns, students, and staff there is rarely a week that goes by where we dont see people saved, delivered, healed, and/or baptized in the Holy Spirit. 

SBHOP serves as home to the School of Jesus and 100 Revelations and regularly has the honor of hosting international and local leaders. The leaders of SBHOP are implementing their vision not only to impact Santa Barbara, but to fuel and  furnish a new era of church growth and identity through renaissance and  reformation on a global scale. ]]></description>

The Sonoma County House of Prayer is open to believers in Jesus Christ. We believe that corporate prayer will have a Kingdom effect on our land. We contend for honor, honor, and honor. The House of Prayer will benefit our region as we seek what is released by the chief intercessor, Jesus. We release third-heaven intercession.

The Prayer House is a 24-hour regional based interdenominational prayer ministry modeled after the Tabernacle of David. It is based on the reality that worship, music and intercession flow together in heaven around God?s throne (Rev. 4:5). This same dynamic was present in what the Scripture calls the ?Tabernacle of David.? In the Old Testament, King David organized prophetic singers and musicians to lead corporate intercession and worship 24 hours a day in Jerusalem (1 Chron. 13-16 & 23?25).]]></description>

The Refuge is not a new idea. It is the heart of God in this day for His people to give themselves to a fasted lifestyle fueled by prayer. We believe that this could not and possibly should not be done by only one community of believers. It should be our desire to labor together in the work of revival. So that as we see the transforming work of the Holy Spirit poured out in our region so we can celebrate as one. So, what is the goal of this house...HEAVEN ON EARTH. How do we get there? We believe that history is in the hands of those who pray. We are calling the history makers from all churches and all denominations to a common ground.]]></description>

About The Prayer Room

The Prayer Room is the central focus of RHOP. Our vision for the Prayer Room is to facilitate worship and intercession, to make prayer effective and enjoyable and to create an atmosphere where people can encounter God on a deep personal level.

Our primary goal in building the prayer room is to partner with God through worship, prayer and fasting to see His Kingdom established in the city of Roseville and surrounding Sacramento region. We believe that night and day worship and prayer will change the spiritual atmosphere of a city, thus opening up the heavens for a greater anointing, power and unity in the Church and an unprecedented harvest of souls.

We have day and night prayer meetings varying between live sessions and streaming video from the International House of Prayer in Kansas City.
Each prayer meeting is broken up into two hour ?sets? and highlights a specific prayer theme or focus
We have one model called the Harp and Bowl Model with 4 different ?prayer formats? or applications of our model. The two primary leaders in our model are the Worship Leader and the Prayer Leader (i.e., healing, city pastors, government, revival, etc.).
Our goal is to eventually have each of these sets led by a live worship team (12 prayer meetings per day x 7 days = 84 weekly prayer meetings).

?The 24 elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.?

Revelation 5:8

The harp speaks of worshiping God with musical instruments.
The bowls speak of the intercessory prayers of the church.]]></description>

Upper Room prayer movement at Vanguard University of Southern California.

We pray and worship, interceding for our campus and its students as well as for Gods will to be done across the earth. Our heart and desire is for students to encounter Jesus and His presence, to become people of prayer who are in love with Jesus and willing to take his love out into the world.

If you are a VU student looking to restart the house of prayer -- firstly, AMEN!! Secondly, please contact the last student leader, Victoria (class of 2020), at the email above for resources and help getting started. :)]]></description>

http://www.24-7tent.com/ <br/>

We pray to see worship and prayer going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until Jesus returns. We want to see communities of 24-7 worship and prayer, where people are filled with humble hearts and want to bring joy to the heart of God. We know that God doesn?t live in buildings anymore, He?s chosen to live in His people (Eph. 2:19-22), and so we are gathering people together who desire to know God?s heart.  Amos 9:11, Acts 15:16

The idea came from King David. He brought the Ark back to Jerusalem eventually and he put it in a "TENT".  Biblical scholars believe that the tent was only about ten feet by fifteen feet.  It was not an extravagant building, only a plain tent that housed extravagant worship.

Earlier, when Moses put the Ark in the Tabernacle, there was a thick curtain separating the people from God?s presence, but David?s tent had no curtain. The Bible also indicates that there was worship going on in the tent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for over 30 years!

The purpose of the 24-7 Tent is simply to gather people to minister to God. We want worship and prayer to the Lord to be the focus. Play an instrument, sing, shout, put on a CD and dance or reflect and listen. The 24-7 Tent is an invitation to be with Jesus - that our constant attention and intimate heartfelt worship would be to Him]]></description>

Prayer

Holy Habitation ? 24/7 on site prayer ? it is the desire of this ministry to have ?on site? 24/7 prayer. This is a work in progress. We are working diligently to fill every hour of the day and night for the entire year. The bible says that, when we draw near to HIM, HE does draw near to us. As we minister to the heart of our Heavenly Father, HIS glorious presence is manifested in our midst. Like any parent, our Abba Father loves having a close relationship with HIS children. During this time, we not only bless the heart of the Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the precious Holy Spirit, but also anyone else who comes in needing prayer, salvation, etc.

Every prayer host prays daily for prayer requests that are sent in during the month from individuals who have a desire for us to come into agreement with them for specific needs they may have. These requests are prayed for everyday for the entire month]]></description>

The Lord has called us to be a community of believers committed to God, each other, and to establishing a  house of prayer in Arapahoe County. A continual solemn assembly gathering corporately to fast and pray in the spirit of the Living God.

At the Arapahoe House of Prayer of Arapahoe County in Colorado, we are committed to prayer, fasting, the Great Commission, and to living as forerunners, preparing for the unique dynamics of the end times. The work of our ministry includes equipping and sending out prayer warriors and evangelists who work to see revival within the Church and a harvest among those searching for God. We take seriously the mandate to train believers to love Jesus and others wholeheartedly as together we go forth to preach the Word, heal the sick, serve the poor, plant houses of prayer, and proclaim the return of Jesus across the earth.

Our hearts desire is to have night-and-day prayer with worship. And we believe this will be made possible in the near future.

Our vision is to prepare thousands of prayer warriors who, like John the Baptist, live a lifestyle of discipline and devotion to God. As forerunner messengers, their lives and voices cry out, "Prepare the way of the Lord!" We invite you to visit our events page for prayer service times at www.thewordandprayer.org/ahop.  Join with us as we set our hearts to love God, worship Him alone, and dedicate our lives to serving Him without reservation; to demonstrate our love for others by encouraging them to grow in intimacy with the Living God.

The Arapahoe House of Prayer of Arapahoe County in Colorado is a ministry of The word & Prayer Ministries that is committed to praying for the release of the fullness of Gods power and purpose, as we actively win the lost, heal the sick, make disciples, and impact the nations with the truth of the gospel. Our vision is to work in relationship with the larger Body of Christ to serve the Great Commission, as we seek to fulfill our ministrie]]></description>

Vision  
Our vision is to see the Church in Colorado strengthened to fulfill its assignment 
of  representing Christ; and to do so with a unified vision for societal 
transformation in every city evidenced by the Lord?s presence and blessings,

Mobilizing
We desire to serve the local church, by helping facilitate worship and prayer 
gatherings throughout Colorado.

We also desire to see Colorado covered in non-stop prayer 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week and will accomplish this through a network of intercessors linked

Colorado Unified began with people just like you!  Hungry to find a community of like-minded, Jesus loving people; we?ve discovered over the years that God is up to something beautiful in Colorado with His kids.  Different expressions of worship, prayer gatherings and kingdom communities have been budding, and we are dedicated to making them known!

THE WEBSITE
Prayerfully, you will find this website to be a resource full of helpful information to get you connected in real-time to local ministries and events!

THE GATHERINGS
Every quarter, Colorado Unified rallies together these praying and worship communities to minister to the Lord and His people in prayer and worship during a full 24-hour period.  Modeled after Revelation chapter 4, we join night and day with heaven to sing, stand, proclaim His praises and intercede before the Lord as a community.
 
?So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, 
and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land??
  Ezekiel 22:3]]></description>

Mission and Vision

Mission of Denver House of Prayer

To provide a facility and context where intercessory 
worshippers can gather to pursue and gain intimacy 
with God in the atmosphere of continual prayer, 
meditation on His Word and gazing on His Glory. 
We believe that as the First Commandment (Matt. 22:37) 
takes first place in our lives, the Second Commandment 
will be fulfilled through us in acts of mercy and justice.
 
Our mission is to partner with and support local 
churches & leaders, prayer ministries and justice 
organizations in a spirit of unity through corporate prayer.
 
Our mission is to seek to live in 100% obedience to the Sermon on the Mount life-style fueled by fasting, prayer, worship and increasing knowledge of the living Jesus.

Vision of Denver House of Prayer

To see God raise up a House of Prayer in the Denver Metro area where night & day worship and prayer rises as perpetual incense before His throne (Rev. 8:3, Luke 18:7-8). We desire to see Him gather watchmen from across the area to stand as priests before Him in 24/7 intercession releasing His will and Kingdom dominion in our community and across the earth as He prepares His bride for her end-time purpose and plan]]></description>

Corporate Prayer - Group prayer times on Thursday nights 7 pm led by the Holy Spirit and generally guided by Christian Fiadonu, the prayer center director. Often there is some teaching based on peoples needs. We pray for the community and beyond, and for individual or corporate needs based on what the Spirit is saying. Hearing from God as a group and sharing what God is doing in individual lives and the community is very encouraging and fosters a deeper intimacy with our Lord. Come join us - everyone is welcome.

Live Worship- Thursday nights  6 pm  led by the Holy Spirit live worship.Worship is before corporate prayer and sometimes mixed together.

About Us
HOPE exists with the prayer of Jesus as our vision: ?Your Kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.? One thing we know about heaven is that it is a place of constant intercession and praise. This aspect heaven?s culture, 24/7 prayer and worship, is something we desire to reproduce in our city. Thus, our mission and initiatives align simply with this vision:
Our desire and charge is to mobilize God?s people in Englewood towards continuous prayer and worship.
We will accomplish this through the following initiatives:
  Call God?s people to participate in a prayer and worship movement.
  Create spaces for God?s people to pray and worship both individually and corporately.
  Equip God?s people to pray with power and worship with joy.

Since 2001 we have done what God has called us to do, which is to lay the spiritual foundation for a full-time house of prayer in Castle Rock. We believe that God will call teams of full-time prayer missionaries to Castle Rock to begin building this House to full-time status.

It is significant that our worship team members are from several different churches because from the beginning we have felt that the Lord was calling The House of Prayer in Castle Rock to be a ministry of the church body in the city, not just of one church. Although we are currently covered and housed by The Rock church in Castle Rock, we have a vision as a ministry to serve the community, along with the support of several other area churches, and becoming a ministry of those churches to the city of Castle Rock and Douglas County in general]]></description>

What is The Upper Room?
? A place rooted in the Word of God
? It?s a place that helps fulfill the great commandments of Loving God and Loving neighbors.
? It provides a safe place for people to discover how God created them to love and communicate and then put it into practice through various forms of individual and group prayer, activities and workshops.
? It is a place for the community of Christ to converge across any dividing line.

Better yet, Its like being HOME. Its that warm place where family and friend gather to communion. Its that safe place where you run to for refuge. Its where you get to recline at the table with Jesus and are confronted with a God so powerful he kneels to wash your feet.

Its something that has to be experienced?]]></description>

Vision
The vision of the Boulder House of Prayer is to engage in God?s Heart for the city of Boulder through prayer, worship, and service to the community.

Mission
The Boulder House of Prayer is a community of people who are committed to praying for God?s will to be done in Boulder even as we work to reach the lost, heal the broken, help the poor, make disciples, and impact the seven spheres of society (family, religion, education, media, celebration, economy, and government). We see ourselves as a servant organization and desire to work with the larger Body of Christ to serve the Great Commission as we follow His Great Gommand to love God and love others.

Practice
As the Boulder House of Prayer, our primary goal is to partner with God in creating and sustaining an environment of continuous prayer and worship. We believe that God responds when His people pray, so we believe that we are most productive when we are in the prayer room. We also recognize that God likes to use people of prayer to answer prayers and that He has called us to be in the world (though not ?of? it), so we allow Him to take us from the prayer room into areas of service to our community. It is because He wants people of prayer to be involved in society that BHOP partners with others in the Body of Christ to reach out the community in ways that deliberately engage in the seven spheres of society. Practically, we do this by praying for issues and for influential people in society, by training and equipping people to be effective in prayer even as they engage in society, and by engaging in society ourselves. We believe that God has specific plans, passions, and purposes for individuals, so we attempt to encourage people to pray, to worship, and to serve Christ wherever they are and wherever their passions are.

The 20/20 Vision
20/20 Leadership at the Boulder House of Prayer is expected to demonstrate the vision of the House through their actions. Believing in the power of prayer, this core leadership team engages in prayer for the community with at least 20 hours of their time. Seeking to partner with God in answering prayer, leadership engages in service to the community with another 20 hours of their time. Leaders will choose an area of particular focus of service within the community that reflects their talents and passions and that deliberately impacts at least one of the seven spheres of society and that builds the House of Prayer. In a lifestyle of cooperation and partnership, leaders will develop relationships with a team of partners with at least two hours of their week]]></description>

Connecticut is in need of prayer. The Connecticut Capital Prayer Network (CCPN) is a ministry dedicated to activating and educating the Church in intercession for our Governmental Leaders.

CCPN wants to bring about change in Connecticut through informed intercession. Governmental Intercessors across the State of Connecticut will support our leaders in prayer and be a voice for righteousness.
  
"I exhort therefore, that, first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty." 1 Timothy 2:1, 2

We are a house of prayer located in Hartford, Connecticuts state capital.
History has shown the greatest revivals started because groups of people sacrificed their lives in prayer and intercession.  If there were no David Brainerd, there may not have been the first Great Awakening.  If there were no Father Nash, there may not have been a second Great Awakening.  If Frank Bartleman didn?t pray, would there have been the great Asusa Street Revival?

?For the eyes of ADONAI move here and there throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong on behalf of those who are wholehearted toward him.? (Complete Jewish Bible)

There are some of us living in Connecticut who not only are willing, but are longing to see God move in our region. We are praying transdenominationally and cross-culturally.  We realize the only way revival will come to our land is if the Body of Christ come outside their individual churches and pray together.]]></description>

Strategically located only a couple blocks away from the Supreme Court and the Capitol Building, JHOP DC facilitates training and corporate prayer and fasting through young adult internships. While other interns in DC are learning the trade of government, our interns are learning the trade of governing through prayer. Luke 18 gives us a mandate to never give up in night and day prayer for justice. This draws us near the heart of God in His great desire to release justice in the earth and ultimately the return of Jesus, the Just One. 

Join us Friday nights at 7pm for our Friday Night Rumble or visit jhopdc.com/schedule for our full schedule of prayer room hours and Silent Sieges]]></description>

Welcome!
DE-HOP is part of a larger out pouring of a global prayer movement. That out pouring is praying and worshipping before the throne of God day and night without ceasing. Keeping the fire on the alter. Modeling after the Tabernacle of David, (1st Chronicles 13-16; 23-25).


Our desire to have a place where anyone can come and be surrounded by the Creator of all things and sense and know that He is good and only does good, and to be free to respond to God (joyfully, quietly, exuberantly, in song, dance, etc..). 


The prophet Isaiah predicted a global Holy Spirit minisrty that would fill the earth in the generation of the Lords return. This prayer minisrty will be filled with Joy; truly enjoyable to participate in. (Isaiah 56:7)

God is raising up prayer furnaces all over the world in these last days and we want to take our possition here in Delaware. We encourage you to be a part and take a stand in the prayer room called DE-HOP.]]></description>

About
CC-HOP is based off the Tabernacle of David. 24/7 Worship and Prayer.
General Information
The tabernacle of Daveid was a 24/7 worship and prayer furnace consisting of singers, musicians and intercessors who ministered before the Lord night and day. Jesus Says in Matthew (21:13), Mark (11:17), and Luke (19:46) that His house shall be called a house of prayer, quoting from the prophet Isaiah (56:7,8)

We believe the Lord is raising up His house of prayer all over the world. He is gathering people from all His church to cry out before Him day and night. We believe Charlotte County is called to be a part of this growning world wide.

One of the ways the Lord is making His beople joyful in the house of prayer is by the merging of worship (music, harp), the word and prayer. (Revelation 5:18)

The Lord is answering the prayer He taught His disciples in Matthew 6:10: "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in haeaven." by revealing what is happening in heaven 24/7 and causing it to be done here on earth. Revelation 4+5]]></description>

The vision of Encounter House of Prayer is to have people praying every hour of every day within our community; we believe that this will come to pass as our passion for prayer rises within us through His spirit. We are committed to prayer and fasting and to living as forerunners preparing for the unique dynamics of the end times.

about
Two figures from the Bible helped inspire Encounter House of Prayer:

Anna was the first evangelist and forerunner in the New Testament who prayed and fasted for over sixty years before Jesus first coming. "... and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four years who did not depart from the temple but served God with fasting and prayers night and day"- Luke 2:37.

King David organized and paid four thousand musicians and almost three hundred singers to worship God night and day (1 Chronicles 23:1-5).

We believe in the prophecy that claims the prayer of His people will usher in the return of our Messiah. We want to be a part of that group! Encounter House of Prayer was launched within our community with the vision of growing into a full-time 24-7 prayer room]]></description>

The mission of FIREFALL International House of Prayer includes equipping and training Prayer Missionaries as dedicated worshipers, intercessors, and evangelists working to see revival in the Church and a great harvest among those who dont know Jesus. Our desire is for Prayer Missionaries to be raised up who will impact the ends of the earth for the Kingdom of God and leaders to be released in the Church worldwide who are faithfully committed to a lifestyle of prayer and fasting.]]></description>

FPNs Guiding Principles:
Since Florida Prayer Networks primary reason for existence is to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to pray for revival in our state and nation, we have firm beliefs about both the Christian faith and the importance of prayer. These principles are drawn from the wisdom of the Bible and the Judeo-Christian ethic, rather than from the humanistic notions of todays theorists.

We believe that the ultimate purpose in living is to know and glorify God and to attain eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, beginning within our own families and then reaching out to a suffering humanity that does not know of His love and sacrifice.

We believe that the institution of marriage was intended by God to be a permanent, lifelong relationship between a man and a woman, regardless of trials, sickness, financial reverses or emotional stresses that may ensue.

We believe that children are a heritage from God and a blessing from His hand. We are therefore accountable to Him for raising, shaping and preparing them for a life of service to His Kingdom and to humanity.

We believe that human life is of inestimable worth and significance in all its dimensions, including the unborn, the aged, the widowed, the mentally handicapped, the unattractive, the physically challenged and every other condition in which humanness is expressed from conception to the grave.

We believe that God has ordained three basic institutions ? the family, the church and the government ? for the benefit of all humankind. The family exists to propagate the race and to provide a safe and secure haven in which to nurture, teach and love the younger generation. The church exists to minister to individuals and families by sharing the love of God and the message of repentance and salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ. The government exists to maintain cultural equilibrium and to provide a framework for social order.

We believe that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman avails much and can bring about revival in our state and nation. Therefore FPN will work to network with others for the cause of Christ. Prayer does reach the heart of God and will make a difference in the family, in the church and in government]]></description>

PRAYER is the spiritual line of communication between Christian believers and our God.

God revealed HOPE, House Of Prayer Exalted, to Deanna in a dream over twenty years ago. Many such facilities are being raised up all over the world. A Christian "House Of Prayer" may differ in design, structure and form, but the main purpose is to set apart a place where people, from all denominations, can enter into personal prayer requests with competent prayer partners, engage in intercessory prayer, make declarations and worship God. Many operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week either from a physical location or through telephone prayer lines or some form of media technology.

Our world is in tremendous turmoil; uncertainty and fear has griped the hearts and minds of many people today. It is only through genuine biblical prayer and worship that God is able to restore peace and hope to a generation. Knowing there is someone available 24/7 that will stand with you in times of trial brings much comfort to the hurting person. It is our hearts desire to offer this service of the Lord through HOPE, House Of Prayer Exalted.

We both have many years of Christian biblical study and hands on ministry. We have held several ministry leadership positions and have functioned as small group leaders. We have developed and served on several intercessory prayer teams. For four years we participated as prayer line phone counselors for a national television ministry.

William and Deanna Brown are licensed ministers of House Of Prayer Exalted, Inc. of Florida and function as a Ministry Connect under the Apostolic covering of Glory of Zion, Inc. of Texa]]></description>

IHOP-Fort Lauderdale is community of believers committed first to pursuing intimacy with God. Our prophetic mandate is to establish a night and day house of prayer in the Fort Lauderdale MSA. 

At IHOP?Fort Lauderdale, we are committed to prayer, fasting, and the Great Commission. As forerunners, we have keen understanding of the end-times and an eternal mindset?and both fuel our urgency to reach the lost even as we cry out for revival in South Florida. And as a missions base, our goal is to equip believers for the work of the ministry in this eleventh hour.

Like John the Baptist, we are humbly working to prepare the way of the Lord. We are committed to raising up apostolic messengers and prophetic intercessors who with an anointing to love God, love others and execute His will on the earth through day and night prayer and works of justice]]></description>

IHOP PANAMA CITY

The Lord burdened the hearts of a remnant to build His house of prayer in Panama City. After answering the call, we began meeting at a local Methodist church on Friday and Sunday nights to begin building His mandate. We will not despise the small beginnings and praise God for placing it on the heart of the pastor of Springfield "New Lighted" Methodist Church to allow us to use the sanctuary as a temporary location. We follow the trail that was blazed before us in prayer and song using the IHOP model.

HOW WE GOT STARTED

Global Day of Prayer is an annual prayer event which includes 10 days of 24 hour prayer. We started a Global Day of Prayer in Panama City and birthed out of the 10 day of 24 hour prayer a need for a 24/7 house of prayer in our city. After praying weekly for 3 years, the Lord finally made a way to implement the IHOP model at a local church. The more we gather to pray in this way, the more we increased in passion, desire, and zeal to see it come to fruition. While its not always easy, its always worth it. Attending the Calls and One Thing conferences just continues to repeatedly confirm Gods heart in this matter and that this is HIS desire and HIS heart and not ours. We firmly believe that although the numbers are small and the days are few, He WILL do what HE said He would do, make His name a praise in all the earth! We believe that this is the generation that will make a change in the world and among the church. We are urging all the young adults to start seeking God and going deeper with God because this is the end-times generation and it is time to start preparing for his second coming and through IHOP, many young people will be able to go deeper with God as some of our youth who just got back from the One Thing conference have. The prayer room must be driven and led by the young adults to draw their generation in and lead them to Christ so come on in young people! :]]></description>

On May 7, 1999, the International House of Prayer Missions Base (IHOP?KC) was founded by Mike Bickle and 20 full-time ?intercessory missionaries? who cried out to God in prayer with worship for 13 hours each day. Four months later, on September 19, 1999, our prayer and worship expanded to the full 24/7 schedule. IHOP?KC is an evangelical missions organization that is committed to praying for the release of the fullness of God?s power and purpose as we actively win the lost, heal the sick, feed the poor, make disciples, and impact the seven spheres of society (family, education, government, economy, arts, media, and religion). Our vision is to work in relationship with the larger Body of Christ to serve the Great Commission, as we seek to walk out the two great commandments to love God and people.

On September 19, 2009, while celebrating our ten-year anniversary together, we made a sober commitment before God to combine 24/7 prayers for justice with 24/7 works of justice until the Lord returns. Outreach has always been a vital part of our mission. However, at that time, we set our heart to significantly increase our outreach and ministry to others outside our Missions Base. Thus, we are launching many new outreach ministries that will continue 24/7 alongside our 24/7 prayer and worship]]></description>

One thing that we know is "More prayer is good". We feel as though God is raising up people to pray all over the world. We have heard this call and want to be responsive to the Lord?s leading. To that end we have entered into a time of prayer fasting and waiting on the Lord. As a result we believe God is beginning to unfold our part in facilitating corporate prayer in Jacksonville toward a 24/7 prayer reality. We know that we are called to cultivate a community of believers united and dedicated to prayer in Jacksonville through regular corporate prayer meetings.]]></description>

VISION: 

To establish a House of Prayer in Lee County that ministers to the Lord 24/7 for as long as He gives grace to sustain the ministry. 

We are committed to pray and sing the truths of Scripture.  
This will take many forms (the Book of Psalms, the apostolic 
prayers, prophetic declarations throughout the Word of God). 
We are committed to the worship and adoration of Jesus on 
earth as it is in Heaven (as seen in the book of Revelation).  
We are committed to the unity of the Church, the 
transformation of our community by the preaching of the 
Gospel, and finally the prayer of the Spirit and the Bride 
saying "Come Lord Jesus".

WHAT IS KEY OF DAVID HOUSE OF PRAYER? 

A prayer ministry
A worship ministry

THE KEY OF DAVID IS NOT A CHURCH! 
  
All those involved and associated with Key of David House of Prayer are members of their own congregation]]></description>

The phrase ?house of prayer? is from Isaiah 56:7, where it is used twice. 
??These [foreigners] I will bring to My holy mountain and give them joy in My house of prayer. 
Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My altar; for My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.? 

Jesus refers to this verse when casting the money changers from the temple, as recorded in Mark 11:17. 
?Then He taught, saying to them, ?Is it not written, ?My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations?? 
But you have made it a den of thieves.?? (Transcribed also in Mt. 21:13 and Lk. 19:46)

The heart of the house of prayer is perhaps best captured by David?s heart cry in Psalm 27:4: 
?One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in His temple.]]></description>

The Lakeland Prayer Network is an effort to support and connect the various prayer initiatives, events, chapels and resources in the Lakeland area. It seeks to encourage everyone to pray, learn how to effectively pray, grow in prayer, and realize answers to prayer.

The Lakeland Prayer Network seeks to promote prayer and places of prayer with the web site, prayer seminars, community gatherings and personal prayer retreats. Recognizing that we are all actually "beginning to pray" and rely on the Lord to "teach us to pray," we will teach and offer prayer resources that are Christ-centered and come from the prayer traditions of the Church world-wide. Our emphasis will be on the "prayer of the sinner" vs. the "prayer of the publican" and "prayer in secret" vs. "prayer to show-off in front of others."

The Lakeland Prayer Network is not about "show." Its about "GO." We seek to fulfill the Great Commission by Prayer Evangelism. And as it attributed to St. Francis of Assisi, "Preach the Gospel at all times, and if necessary, use words.]]></description>

We value a culture of prayer in the Church of Brevard County.
·         We value the power of corporate prayer in large or small gatherings.
o   Deuteronomy 32:30 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had surrendered them? NKJV
o   Joshua 23:10 One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the Lord your God is He who fights for you, as He promised you. NKJV
·         We value praying the Word of God. 
o   Jeremiah 23:29 "Is not My word like a fire?" says the Lord, "And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?  NKJV
·         We value a commitment to regular fasting and a fasted lifestyle.
o   Matthew 9:15 And Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. NKJV
o   Mark 9:29 So He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting." NKJ]]></description>

Come join us in prayer for revival in our region!
Mission
The vision of 1HOP is to establish a prayer furnace where Jesus is exalted through night-and-day worship and intercession; To inspire and exhort individuals to extravagant devotion to Jesus Christ through a lifestyle of fasting and prayer, by means of providing a venue for training and ministry, crying out to God for the nations; To partner with the Lord through night and day prayer for spiritual transformation as Jesus receives a great harvest of souls unto Himself; To intercede for the nation of Israel; And to providea reverant and enjoyable atmosphere with live worship, to help this generation of Christians cultivate faithfulness with a community of fasting and prayer.
Description
We are living in the greatest hour of history. The rumblings are everywhere, and a surge of corporate prayer is exploding globally. God is moving and hearts are being stirred to pursue the Lord in prayer and fasting as His people give themselves whole-heartedly to His purposes in the earth. Night and day prayer is arising to God from every corner of the globe. 1HOP is a community of Christian believers, branded by heaven with a vision for prayer, who?s hearts are stirred to live more deeply in the secret place. 1HOP seeks to make great the name of Jesus Christ by gathering members of our local community to engage in worship and intercession for revival, righteousness, justice, and the return of Jesus Christ, mirroring the reality in heaven?s throne room]]></description>

Mary of Bethany  extravagantly worshiped Jesus by pouring her alabaster flask of costly perfume onto His body. For this, the disciples criticized her; yet Jesus commended her. It is our desire to worship Jesus in this way, pouring out our lives before Him. We long for Onething to be a place of encounter?a place for personal transformation, a place of rest; a place where hearts are set free and bodies are healed; a place where believers are unified]]></description>

We also desire to equip believers to live in their bridal identity before God.  This results in whole-hearted love for Jesus and others as we build the church by servi]]></description>

University House of Prayer (UHOP) is a prayer community primarily focused on college students.  UHOP exists to create a culture of prayer on college campuses where a culture of sin abounds.  In the midst of a system of Humanism UHOP desires to train and equip these college students in the lifestyle of relentless, worship and prayer.  The desire is to raise up a company of forerunners like John the Baptist, who are in love with Jesus, able to hear His voice and diligent to follow his leading.

Throughout history revivals have commonly sprung up on collage campuses when small groups of students gather together to seek the Lord.  Two of these are, the holiness club at Oxford University in England in 1729, the Haystack Revival at Williams College in 1806. 

The Holiness Club from Oxford was pivotal in spreading the gospel throughout England and what is now the United States of America. Out of this group came George Whitfield, John Wesley, and Francis Asbury. These men were key in establishing the Methodist church as well as helping to lead the First Great Awakening. 

Shortly thereafter five students from Williams College, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, decided to meet to pray and discuss the spiritual atmosphere of Asia. Through the prayers of these students the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions was founded in 1812. This group was responsible for sending some of the first missionaries to Asia.  

We do not believe that God is finished with college students.  It is our firm belief that if God used college students to lead some of the greatest revivals our country has seen, He will use them again! Currently UHOP is operating on the University of Central Florida, a campus of over 60,000 students. Since its start in August of 2010, UHOP has met together for hundreds of hours of prayer and study of the Word of God. During a Solemn Assembly in October of 2012 our hearts were gripped with the prayer of an old evangelist, named Gypsy Smith, who prayed, ?Father God, send revival and let it start with me.? This is the cry of our hearts, ?Father God, send revival to America once again and let it start with us]]></description>

In October of 2004, we started IHOP Atlanta with trembling in our hearts, yet hopeful that the Lord would indeed build His house of prayer. We started with 40 hours a week of worship and prayer and as God added new people, we added more prayer. In a short period of time, we expanded our weekly prayer meetings to cover 75 hours and later, 120 hours a week. We were amazed as God continued to bring people who, in spite of their own human weakness, were committed to giving themselves to the vision of night and day prayer. On February 12, 2006 what was previously only a dream became a reality, as the IHOP Atlanta prayer room was expanded to cover 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The prayer meeting that started on February 12, 2006 continues to this day, without ceasing. God has continued to gather people from around the nation to see that the fire on the altar never goes out. Its astounding to think that there has never been a worship-led prayer meeting that continued unabated for this length of time in our city, until now! Prayer and worship never cease to arise from our city to our great God.]]></description>

The Macon House of Prayer is a growing community of believers who are committed to God and each other in order to establish a 24/7 house of prayer in Macon, Georgia.  We desire to live lives of prayer, fasting, studying the Word and pursuing the Great Commission.  Intercession and worship are at the center of our ministry before God.  The house of prayer is a place where believers can gather corporately in a solemn assembly to fast and pray in the spirit of the tabernacle of David.  We are committed to training and equipping believers to grow in intimacy with God after the first commandment (Matt. 22:34-40) and to be forerunner messengers like John the Baptist preparing the way of the Lord. We invite you to visit us and join with us as we pursue Jesus with wholehearted love and devotion.]]></description>

At Revival By Fire Ministries, the mission at this time is to pray out stuff that will hinder revival in our neighborhood working out to our city county and state and nation.

We then are to have a Understanding as to the spirit realm to a degree we must know the enemy schemes once we know and pray them off.

We then can know God ways and planes and we pray his will down

Thats how we see revival come down]]></description>

Established by a broad based fellowship of churches across the island of Kaua`i, our desire at KHOP is to exalt and proclaim the Lordship of Jesus Christ, to provide a place (both physical and in our hearts) in which He would desire to dwell 24 hours a day/365 days a year. We believe that God "inhabits the praises of His people" (Psalm 22:3) and are committed to seeing His praises proclaimed creatively and continuously. As we "humble ourselves and pray" and "lift Jesus up" we believe we will see Him "draw all men" to Himself and will "heal our land.]]></description>

Schedule: Creston Heartland House of Prayer is currently in transition and therefore open at certain times, especially for specific events.
          
The CHHOP has been a ministry dedicated to the heart of prayer in the downtown area for people in authority such as the mayor, city council, police, and sheriff departments within the community.  We have also broken down walls in the body of Christ, fulfilling the commands of Jesus, and have established a food bank for the people in need. One of our biggest desires is to have a transition program with the prison system in helping those coming out of jail to get re-established into the community]]></description>

Fort Dodge House of Prayer
Ernie Albrecht Coordinator
 
Weekly  Prayer Meetings  -  Mondays 5-7 pm. and Saturday 8-10 am.

·     Join us 2 hours, 6 days a week as we begin to seek the Lord together in intercessory prayer.  With this as the start, we believe the Fort Dodge House of Prayer will in time be open 24/7.

·       Thursday   Evening   Teachings  -  7 pm.

·         An evening of teachings has been set aside once a week to learn what the House of Prayer is all about, as well as how to seek the Lord and to learn about how to view ourselves as our Father God sees us

·         Solemn Assembly  -  8 pm.

·         Here at the Fort Dodge house of prayer we are doing a Quarterly Scared Assembly and I am teaching one day per week. I plan on expanding to two days a week in the near future. We have hours of prayer from 5pm to 7pm Mon -Fri ,Fri morning from 5 to 7am Saturdays are from 8 to 10am and every Mom from 1:30pm to 3:30 pm. I teaching on the Bridegroom, King and Judge on Thursdays from 7pm to 8:30. I feel at this time that this is where the Lord has lead us. -  Ernie Albrecht- Coordinator

Vision:

- Our vision is to cause there to be unity in the whole Body of Christ by bringing all of the Churches together and to a safe place to seek the Savior.  It is our prayer that they might encounter the Spirit and carry it back to their home church to cause intimacy with God and bring revival to the rest of the body.  We also hope that more Churches begin to seek God in prayer by establishing their own weekly or daily prayer meeting]]></description>

We are a company of people the Lord has called to seek His face in prayer and worship around the clock, similar to the first "house of prayer" - the Tabernacle of David - which was organized and paid for by King David in 1000 B.C. with over 4,000 musicians and 288 singers who were employed to worship God 24/7 (1 Chronicles 23:1?25:31). 
At IHOPE House of Prayer Missions Base, we are committed to prayer, fasting, the Great Commission and works of justice as a lifestyle. The first commandment is our focus, and like John the Baptist, we are friends of the Bridegroom (John 3:29-30).   We are partnering with the Holy Spirit to raise up and release missionaries that are dedicated intercessors who labor to see revival in the church, salvation among the lost and transformation in society. These friends of the Bridegroom are young and old men and women who are committed to seeing Jesus Kingdom break into every area of society by living a radical, wholehearted lifestyle (John 5:35; Luke 7:24-27).

Our vision is to prepare thousands of intercessory missionaries who are extravagant lovers of God and anointed deliverers of men. It is our desire to call this generation into the wilderness of prayer to cultivate a prophetic voice as forerunner messengers.   Their lives and voices cry out, ?Prepare the way of the Lord!? We invite you to visit us online and in person. We invite you to join with us as we set our hearts to love God, serve Him without reservation, love others,  and  transform the Cedar Valley through night and day worship and intercession.   To God be the glory]]></description>

Kingdom House of Prayer [KHOP] is part of the global prayer movement that is transforming cities, fueling the Great Commission, and preparing the way for the return of the Lord Jesus Christ to the planet through prayer and worship. The atmosphere of KHOP is that of live worship and fiery intercession. Our focus is Jesus, and only Jesus. We want to cultivate a greenhouse where freedom to worship radically and crying out to God with abandonment are valued and encouraged. KHOP is heading towards a 24/7 IHOP-KC style, harp & bowl (Rev. 5:8) style settin]]></description>

About the Ark

The Ark is a prayer room that can be used for prayer meetings, bible studies or personal time with God. The Ark is located in downtown Iowa City, across Burlington St. from the Sheraton Hotel, next to Elite Nails (209 E. Burlington St.).  The back door has a code box with the key to lock and unlock the door.  Simply email info@iowacityprayer.org to request the code.
Our vision is that the Ark would be a place of community, prayer and power.  Community because we can do much more together than we can alone.  Jesus prayed in John 17 that we would be one as He and the Father are one. Even though we have different functions and expressions in the Church, we are still called to function as one body. In our corporate gatherings, we strive to put priority on the edification of the assembly over our personal expressions and desires. We pray because we love Jesus!  Prayer is a two-way conversation where we express our hearts to God and receive revelation and empowerment to be used effectively. Central to the concept of prayer is understanding what the Bible says God is like.  If we have a wrong view of God, everything else in life will be affected so we talk to God about who He is and allow Him to reveal Himself to us through the Bible and the Holy Spirit.  We walk in God?s power in order to bring about His kingdom right now wherever we are.  This generation has little interest in religion and dogma so we allow God to use us so many lives can be changed by an encounter with a Living God. Ultimately, the vision of the Ark is to bring about a great awakening and revival in this generation that results in the return of Jesus to the earth]]></description>

Welcome the Cedar Valleys newest expression of Gods love. Since its beginning in 2002, IHOPE has proven to be a blessing to the people of the greater Cedar Falls and Waterloo area.

Two distinct arms of IHOPE are The House of Prayer and the Free Medical Clinic.



Our Mission

There are five principal ways we plan to honor our Lord Jesus Christ. We will...

	Provide a place to experience the presence of the Lord in a deeper way. We are moving toward providing continuous worship and prayer 24/7. In addition to worship music and singing in The House of Prayer, there will be intercessory prayer and reading the word of God. All people in need are welcome.
 
	Encourage a greater passion and intimacy with the Lord Jesus both individually and corporately.
 
	Offer basic medical care to the poor, uninsured and underinsured of the Cedar Valley. This free medical clinic will be staffed by volunteer doctors and nurses who are concerned
 
	Promote unity among the body of believers in the Cedar Valley. Many Christians join together to worship God and pray for their world, their nation, their city, their neighbors, their families and themselves.
 
	Be a resource available to instruct the local body in worship and prayer. Conferences, guest speakers, prayer walks and events are all methods we will use to continue to spread the word of Gods faithfulness.

Yasha offers times of worship, teaching, equipping, and Sozo style prayer appointments, healing ministry, deliverance ministry and whatever else the Lord asks of us. We are open 4 days a week as Yasha, but also house 2 churches, a womens ministry and a Men of Valor ministry.  Our schedule is easiest to find on Facebook at Yasha Ministry-Siouxland.

YASHA HAS 28 DIFFERENT TRANSLATION IN THE BIBLE.
As the verb "yasha" it is translated as variations of the words:  Heal, Save, Deliver, Avenge.  The verb yasha also means, ?to help, to save, to receive, to accept help, to be victorious.?

When Yeshua comes, the rest of yasha is captured.  Help brings victory.  Victory brings salvation.  In salvation we are avenged upon our enemies.

Yasha is a place to experience the healing only Jesus can provide.
Yasha is a place to pray and worship and learn how to be a lover of Jesus.
Yasha is a place to be equipped to minister to the saved and the Lost.
Yasha is a place to exercise spiritual gifts in an atmosphere of love for Jesus and for the Kingdom of God.
Yasha is a place to soak in the presence of Jesus.
Yasha is a place to pray for pastors and The Church in this region.
Yasha is a call to the Church in Siouxland to WAKE UP and join in the battle that is being waged for the souls of men and women in this region...God wants to save our families and our neighbors, our co-workers and total strangers that sleep under the bridge, people that huddle hungry in apartments and ethnic groups from all over the world that now call this region home!  He wants to use us, His Bride, to invite them into fellowship with God through the provision Jesus made for them when He paid the price for their sins on the cross at Calvary.

To that end we train and equip healing room facilitators and worshipers.  And we provide times of worship and intercession for the transformation of this region to the glory of Jesus.]]></description>

About
This is a 24/7 House of Prayer that has the heart and mission to pray for the counties of: America, Israel & Zambia.
Mission
Our Vision Statement

We desire:

1. To call forth, train, and mobilize intercessors to live a life of prayer as they preach the gospel, heal the sick, help the needy, make disciples, and seek to bring transformation to society; to make it our aim to personally live as fully devoted disciples of Jesus, who operate in the forerunner spirit.

2. To establish a perpetual solemn assembly in Hayden, ID by gathering corporately to fast and pray, because we recognize this as essential to establishing justice in society.

3. To train others to plant houses of prayer, churches, and/or marketplace ministries as the Spirit leads]]></description>

About
We are a community of believers seeking intimacy with Jesus and the fullness of God.
Mission
Seeking to change the world and usher in the second coming of Jesus through night and day prayer.
Description
We desire to be a people of One Thing like Mary of Bethany & King David (Psalm 27:4, Luke 10:42). We believe that night and day prayer is crucial to the purposes of God upon the earth and take seriously the mandate to always pray and never give up (Isaiah 62:6-7, Luke 18-7-8).

We believe in the power of Gods Kingdom and believe the words of Jesus are for today. He commands that we make disciples and to lay our hands on sick people, and that signs of power will follow those that believe. Therefore we encourage any that are sick or in need of any healing to join us or request prayer.

We are a non denominational community and bless all who call on Jesus Christ. We are a culture of honor and bless believers from any fellowship. We value the arts including music, painting, dancing, photography, etc...

Our gatherings usually include live sets of worship and intercession with specific prayer mandates throughout the week. We currently meet Monday through Friday from 12pm to 2pm at 835 Blue Lakes Blvd. South & other times as announced through the wee]]></description>

Decatur House of prayer has been designed to reflect the tabernacle of David (1 Chr. 22?24); it is a place where we worship the Lord and intercede for our world. Each one hour period is led by a worship team. There is worship and a time of intercessory prayer where we pray for our city, state and nation. We pray for our youth and families as well.

All are welcome to come and go freely and to stay in the prayer room as long as they like. While in the prayer room, feel free to join in with the corporate worship and prayer, read your Bible, study a favorite commentary, write in your journal, or engage in private prayer. You may sit, stand, or pace up and down the aisles. Whatever you do, we ask that you do it in a manner that honors and serves the other people in the room]]></description>

The vision of the Greater Peoria House of Prayer is to glorify Jesus in the central Illinois region through prayer, worship and works of service. We will carry out our vision by progressively building more prayer gatherings with worship that continue day and night - one day becoming 24/7. We will develop relationships with area churches in order to help promote a loving, prayerful and unified expression of the Body of Christ in our region as well as carry out practical works of service (especially for the poor and needy). We will also operate as a training center that equips believers through conferences, internships and other focused gatherings.]]></description>

Kingdom House of Prayer is a place for worship and prayer, modeled after the International House of Prayer in Kansas City. KHOP is located just outside Chicago in Algonquin, IL, central to many of the citys suburbs. Our prayer room was designed to serve the region, cultivate a spirit of revival and develop healthy community within the Body of Christ. KHOP is open to the public and we love to network with local churches. All are welcome to freely come and go within our hours of operation (see schedule for details). We look forward to worshipping with you in our little gem outside the city]]></description>

Our Vision
Night and Day Prayer According to David . . . 1 Chr 28:19

Our Mission
R2HOP exists to passionately engage believers in perpetual worship and intercession as described by King David?to foster intimacy, to agree with God as it touches the Rock River Valley and beyond, and to announce the fast approaching final hour of natural history.

Our Hearts
We have fallen desperately in love with Jesus, the bridegroom God. The revelation of His intense, fiery desire for us (Songs 8:5-7) has captured our hearts. His love for weak, immature and broken believers has fascinated us and propelled our hearts into passionate and intimate pursuit of relationship with Him. Lovers will always outdo doers!

Agreement With God
When we agree with who God is, we call this worship; and when we agree with Gods purposes, we call this intercession. We proclaim both in song and prayer (1 Chr 16:23-25). David commanded Asaph and his fellow Levites to do this continually (1 Chr 16:1-6).

Restoration
God has promised to restore "all things David" in the last days (Acts 15:16-18), including Davids experience of worship and intercession. David brought the ark of Gods presence to Jerusalem and kept it in his tent (II Sam.6:17). He appointed 288 prophetic singers and 4000 musicians to worship and intercede before the Lord continuously? night and day (1 Chr. 23:5, 30; 25:1, 7).

Night and Day
Praying without ceasing is more than having a continual spirit of prayer (1 Thes 5:17). God intends to bring the church back to the reality of night and day worship and intercession as revealed to David (1 Chr 28:19) which he commanded his servants to keep (2 Chr 29:25).

Praying without ceasing is also about a community of believers that manage their lifestyles so that they can come together and engage in 24/7 intercessory worship]]></description>

The Prayer Furnace Chicago is a city-wide, multi-denominational, worship, and intercessory ministry. Our goal is to build a "corporate altar" on behalf of the city of Chicago where we may stand before Jesus, unified and strengthened in our unyielding love for the worthy Son of Man. The Prayer Furnace is?one?focal point for the churches of the city to come together in unity and pray for revival of our ministries and for the spiritual awakening of our communities to the Gospel of Jesus. We will continually cry out for God to visit our city and release a great harvest of souls, for racial reconciliation, for signs and wonders, and a powerful spiritual movement among the youth. We are?committed to city-wide?involvement of this ministry and ask that all?staff and interns?be involved in their local churches.]]></description>

Over the last year there have been over 20 key prophetic events signifying the hour for building the House of Prayer in Evansville, Indiana has come. Some of these events have been very dramatic, some simply confirming, all pointing the same direction while increasing in frequency. It is time to build the House of Prayer! (Hag. 1:2) We acknowledge the previous decades of prayer asking for a significant move of God in the region, and view this hour as a cumulative event]]></description>

WHEN THE CHURCH IS UNIFIED, JESUS IS GLORIFIED!
We are a medley of followers of Jesus from various churches, ministries, and denominations who come together in corporate worship-based prayer. We are not a local church, but serve as a common ground for all believers who share the eternal bond of faith in Jesus Christ.

WHAT WE DO
Our mission is to promote unity in the body of Christ by bringing glory to God with one voice and one heart through biblically inspired, enjoyable worship-based prayer.

WHY WE DO THIS
Biblically inspired prayer and worship unifies our hearts with God?s eternal perspective. Our faith is strengthened and our hope is renewed as we give our complete devotion to God, understanding that He hears and answers our prayers according to the promises in His Word. Time spent engaging with the Holy Spirit in prayer and in God?s Word has the power to transform our hearts. In this, we become more like Jesus in shining the light of His love and helping others to find and follow Him!

God is raising up a global prayer movement that is fueling an unprecedented increase in missions unto the fulfillment of the Great Commission. As part of this movement, we are here to join the world-wide body of Christ in day and night prayer, proclaiming the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ to every nation until He returns!

HOW WE DO THIS
? The Prayer Room - A space dedicated to those seeking an opportunity to participate in worship-based prayer (harp & bowl) gatherings. 
? The Pursuit: Experience Him - A season of committed devotion in the prayer room to seek the heart of God with others through biblically centered worship-based prayer.
? Workshops - Interactive classes designed to help cultivate a lifestyle of encountering God through prayer and worship.
? Taste & See Experience - Mobile prayer and worship teams that are sent out to inspire the Body of Christ and shine the love of Christ in our community.

WHAT WE ARE BELIEVING FOR
? Unity in the Body of Christ

WVIHOP Directors Marvin and Sally Adams moved to the Wabash Valley in May 2008 and officially launched WVIHOP in July 2008 with our Friday evening DESIRE MORE prayer gathering for the region.  The Adams have been leading in the prayer movement for over 10 years and in full-time ministry for almost 20 years.  After ministering in Chicago for  a number of years, they  moved to Kansas City in 1998 and ended up helping launch IHOP-KC.  In 1999 they moved back to Chicago and in 2000 planted the house of prayer in downtown Chicago and directed there until 2006.  In 2006 they movedback to Kansas City to join the leadership team of IHOP-KC where Marvin helped direct the Forerunner Music Academy.  In 2008, Marvin and Sally felt the leading of the Lord to move to the Terre Haute region to sow into the prayer movement in the Wabash Valley.

Our vision from the Lord is to be a community of believers committed to God, each other, and to establish a day and night sustained house of prayer in the Wabash Valley where we stand as a   perpetual solemn assembly gathering corporately to fast and pray with the same mandate King David received: a tabernacle of God?s continual abiding. 

At WVIHOP, we are committed to prayer, fasting, the Great Commission, and to living as forerunners, preparing for the unique dynamics of the end times. The work of our ministry includes equipping and sending out missionaries as dedicated intercessors and evangelists who work to see revival within the Church and a harvest among those searching for God. We take seriously the mandate to train believers to love Jesus and others wholeheartedly as together we go forth to preach the Word, heal the sick, serve the poor, plant houses of prayer, and proclaim the return of Jesus across the earth.]]></description>

The Holy Spirit has birthed a worldwide prayer movement so that God can bring healing to our souls and transformation to our world. We feel both privileged and grateful to be a part of this Heavenly mission.


The vision of Living Waters House of Prayer is in full agreement with the Lord Jesus. We will pray in unity and purpose. We will worship night and day with the perseverance of Anna, the passion of David, and the vision of Abraham.  And, we will extend Gods kingdom with all the resources He puts at our disposal]]></description>

The Southeast Kansas House of Prayer (SEKHOP) is reaching out for a unification of counties in Southeast Kansas. The purpose is to offer up 24/7 praise and worship to the Lord at a central location. We are seeking singers and musicians from these counties to join us in prayer and intercession through team-led shifts. We follow the harp and bowl model, and are in link with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, MO, the Crossroads IHOP in Joplin, MO, and the Topeka HOP in Topeka, KS. SEKHOP is currently covering a time frame of 6pm to 12am on Thursdays by Crawford county volunteers, but we desire to see that expand. Two of the hours are dedicated to train new volunteers (Discovery Zone). Please contact George or Susan Powers at (620) 232-1903 for more information.]]></description>

Currently only meet Thursdays from 7pm-9pm BUT our 4 worship teams are excellent and soon we will be adding more regular hours as we continually our building new worship teams. Our worship teams are very solid, some coming from IHOPKC and one used to sing with Misty Edwards. Our prayer meetings are best described as a river where we are just flowing along where the river takes us, sometimes its wild and sometimes its calm, but we stay in the flow of the river.]]></description>

I have been in full time ministry for over nine years now and are loving every minute of it. In October 2009, we were given a great vision to begin a ministry named Uprising Movement. Our goal is simple ? to raise up passionate followers of Jesus and to make Him known in our city, in our generation. Our prayer for Uprising Movement comes out of Isaiah 62:1 (NLT): ?Because I love this city, because my heart yearns for her, I cannot remain silent. I will not stop praying for her until her righteousness shines like the dawn, and her salvation blazes like a burning torch.? My desire is to be a torch for God who sets cities and nations ablaze for His glory and to equip, empower and mobilize people to do the same where they work, go to school, and live ? in their city, nation, and generation. We are moving forward with this vision in the following ways:

Evangelism ? I have traveled all over the nation and seen hundreds of people give their lives to Jesus and thousands of people healed by the power of God. I speak at conferences as well as at local churches to support pastors in ministering to their people, praying for the sick, leading the lost to Jesus, and helping to build their local church. I partner with local pastors, youth pastors, and ministries on how to grow the church, facilitate small groups, provide discipleship training for alter call ministry, and build and train their teams. I also explain strategies on how to get into local public schools, serve the schools, start ministries in schools, or join existing local ministries in the schools. Students must be equipped, empowered, and mobilized to get involved in leading and or joining these ministries on their campus. In addition, I minister in various homeless outreach ministries to feed and clothe people in need, get them saved, and connect them to the local church.

Campus Director ? I work with Gary Newell and Outreach America as their Campus Director. Eighty-seven percent of biracial single parent kids end up dead or incarcerated by the age of thirty. Many students today have distorted beliefs about God and the Bible. This generation of youth has redefined Christianity according to their culture, not according to truth. The lost are not running to the church, so we MUST go get them. It does matter what our students believe about God and His Word. Outreach America has ministered on more than 500 high school and college campuses across this nation. I am a motivational speaker in middle schools, high schools, and college campuses. I also work as a Chaplin with the launching of Veritas Sports Academy, a radical, ?never been done before? approach to reaching a lost generation with the message of Christ through the world of athletics. Check out outreachamerica.org for more information about the ministries and impact of Outreach America.

The U ? Fifty percent of the Earth?s population is fifteen years old or younger, and seventy percent are 20 years old and younger! There are 25,189 high school and middle school students in Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties. These numbers are not seen in the church today. Eighty-seven percent of young people that go to church while growing up and graduate from high school will never come back to church. It is time to go and get them for the Kingdom.

In our society today, church has the reputation of being old, boring, and irrelevant. We want to create an atmosphere where young adults can encounter God and learn practically how to live for Jesus. We are officially a campus organization and will be doing Bible studies and small groups to unite students on campus. We currently are on the campus on Northern Kentucky University and are planning to start a service on or by local colleges, high schools and middle schools in the Tri-state Area. As an outreach from The U, we have planned to target families in need and give them dinner, groceries and gifts for holidays as well as minister to them. We believe in reaching out to the local community and helping those that are in need]]></description>

At LaHOP we gather as voluntary, lovesick worshippers of Jesus, where our passion for God, calling for intercession, and heart for worship meet with one voice.

Our prophetic community is dedicated to seek the Lord Jesus through fasting, prophetic intercession, and worship.

We provide various teachings and ministry to the sick, broken and disheartened of the world through prophetic soaking prayer, inner healing, and deliverance.

It is our heart to minister with Bridal Intimacy in 24/7 House of Prayer with two hour watches patterned after the Tabernacle of David.

Purposing in our hearts toward the Lord Jesus - "To know Him and to make Him known
(We are a small community which ran the LaHOP for over 15 years and are now meeting as a community of missionaries, as of 2017)]]></description>

International House of Prayer of New Orleans Missions Base founded January 2012

We are an evangelical non-profit religious organization. We will have staff that are (intercessory) missionaries and raise their own support or work jobs outside of IHOP New Orleans for their income.

The Mission of IHOP New Orleans is to change the spiritual atmosphere of our region through worship and intercession and building night and day prayer in our region. Our hope and desire is to see churches, faith communities and fellowships of believers develop their own personal culture of prayer in order to see night and day prayer arise across the city that revival might break forth in our region.

Weekly, we meet in the directors home in Metairie on Tuesday nights at 7:00 and 138 N. Broad in New Orleans on Saturdays at 6:00. Following both of those worship and prayer sets we have a time of equipping for the saints in our city around a variety of subjects]]></description>

IHOP-NOLA (International House of Prayer New Orleans Louisiana), founded in July of 2011 by Harold & Erin Moreland, is a House of Prayer worship center located in the Greater New Orleans area. We are just across the Mississippi River from downtown New Orleans. Corporate prayer & worship is every Saturday evening from 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM, but feel free to join-in at anytime and leave whenever you need and/or what fits your schedule. Each prayer watch consists of a Harp & Bowl worship format along with an intercession/prayer focus and related scripture. We are always looking for those gifted in worship leading, vocal back-up, musicians, and intercessors to join us as we continue to establish Gods House of Prayer in New Orleans. Email us at info@ihop-nola.com or visit us at www.ihop-nola.com for additional information and/or directions to the prayer room. Blessings, Brother Harold Moreland]]></description>

The Louisiana Apostolic Prayer Network exists to provide alignment and networking for God?s triumphant reserve in Louisiana for the cause of revival and reformation in our state and nation. We are reminded in Psalm 127:1 that unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it... We trust Him to build a house of prayer for Louisiana, to raise up an army of leaders and intercessors to advance His Kingdom throughout every area of society--business, government, family, church, education, media, and arts and entertainment. We have included here an overview of our state to help facilitate effective intercession including the redemptive purpose of Louisiana, prayer direction for 2011, and a brief state history. If you are called to this assignment, may your spirit be quickened to pray and to join the ranks of other prayer warriors God is raising up across the state to ?stand in the gap? for Louisiana!]]></description>

Location: Boston, MA<br/>
<br/>
We meet at Congregacion Leon de Juda, 68 Northampton Street, Boston, Massachusetts from noon-3ish Tuesday-Friday.

We are in one of the most strategic locations in Boston. We are across the street from the largest abortion clinic in Boston.  We are 5 blocks from Symphony Hall, 10 blocks  from Fenway Park, and we are on the border between Roxbury and the South End.  This is one of the most diverse sections of the city, including the gay community, the center of the African American community, the headquarters of the Christian Science Church, the Kennedy library, the Latino community, and several universities.

What is the long term goal?

Ultimately, to build a center of prayer and worship that prepares the way for Jesus to reign on the earth.  Our main focus is this prayer: Your Kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

This house of prayer is unique from other prayer ministries in Boston because of its multicultural DNA and its call to raise up artists and creative people to be army of God.  Our goal is to create an embassy of heaven through redeemed art and culture.

We also care deeply for Jerusalem and pray daily for the promises in Isaiah 62 to come to pass:  that we will not rest or be silent until Jerusalem is a praise in the earth.

As we release the sound of heaven through worship and prayer, and the beauty of heaven through light and color, we are releasing into the atmosphere of Boston the atmosphere of heaven.

In heaven there is no sickness, disease, dysfunction, death, poverty, corruption or brokenness.  We also believe that in heaven God has answer to every human problem.]]></description>

The Justice House of Prayer (JHOP) in Boston/Cambridge exists to raise up a house of prayer to contend with every other house that challenges the Lordship and supremacy of Christ over all affairs. Birthed out of TheCall prayer assemblies, the Justice House of Prayer in Boston/Cambridge is a community of young and old who seek to lift a continuous (24/7) cry of worship and intercession for and out of our nations birthplace]]></description>

Pioneer Valley House of Prayer began in 2008 with the vision of simply ministering to the Lord and interceding for the Pioneer Valley and New England.
Mission
The Kingdom of God and all of His Righteousness
Description
Our purpose is to intercede for the Pioneer Valley and all of New England. We desire to see the Church of Jesus Christ stand tall in Righteousness and Truth and be all that it was called to be, that the Sons of God might be manifest in this earth to a groaning Creation. We gather every 3rd Friday of the month. Generally the gathering includes a time of praise and worship and prayer, which is open for whomever feels the unction to lead out in prayer. We first take the time to minister to the Lord and then afterward, if there is a personal need, we like to have a time of ministering to the people, whether it be a physical, spiritual or emotional need, etc.

Ezekiel 22:30 says that the Lord looked for a man among them that would make up the hedge and stand in the gap for the land, that He would not destroy it, but He found none. Let us be the ones of this day that would lay aside our own agenda and desires and stand in the gap, interceding for this land, that He would not destroy it. God desires action and obedience from His Sons, so let us "Arise and shine for the Light HAS come and the glory of the Lord is upon us!" 2 Chronicles 7:14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land. Jesus Jesus Jesus!!!]]></description>

We believe that God is restoring the fire of intercession back to the altar in our land and 24/7 prayer is being reignited! We believe it is not an option or the office of a select few, but a mandate that must be acted upon for the fulfillment of the promises in our land. In response to this mandate, we are beginning networked/unified houses of prayer throughout the state of Maine, and beyond.

Recently  God began to press upon our hearts a desire to gather His people together in prayer.  One of the first scriptures He opened up to us was Prov. 29:18 ?Where there is no vision, the people perish.?
We waited on Him.  A familiar scripture came to life once again in our hearts.  Habakkuk 2:2 ?And the Lord answered me and said, write the vision and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.?
After waiting and praying, we read in Isaiah what He wanted this work to be called.  Isa. 56:6-7 made it plain,  ?Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine alter: for mine house shall be called a HOUSE OF PRAYER for all people.]]></description>

The Bridge Street House of Prayer is an urban ministry/church located on the West Side of Grand
Rapids, MI. We are here for one reason above all: to see Jesus exalted. We have a great desire to see
our friends and neighbors drawn out of a lifestyle of poverty and into the marvelous light of Jesus. We
desire that the BSHOP would serve as a bridge from the chaos and despair of the streets to the full and
abundant life that Jesus offers.

Beyond our neighborhood, we believe that God is doing a great work among the youth of our city (and
around the globe). We want to see this next generation stake their rightful place as sons and daughters,
priests and prophets of God, captivated with a vision of the magnificence of Jesus, equipped to live
lives of godliness, and sent out to make Him known in our city and among the nation]]></description>

The Grand Rapids House of Prayer (GRHOP) is a community of believers committed to building a 24/7 worship and prayer center in the spirit of David?s Tabernacle.  (Amos 9:11, Acts 15:16) The GRHOP does not desire to replace or compete with the church, but rather unify and sustain the church until the glorious return of Jesus Christ.  We welcome all people and denominations into this ministry in a joint effort to advance the Kingdom and be a house of prayer for all people. (Isa 56:7)

We seek to encourage each other to live as Jesus taught (fasting, praying, giving and serving) in pursuit of wholehearted love and devotion to Jesus Christ. (Mt 6)

We believe that God desires to be worshiped on earth as it is in heaven, and we seek to offer worship and prayer to God night and day in agreement with the worship order in heaven. (Mt 6:10, Rev 4-5)
    
We believe that night and day worship and intercession is deeply connected to an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that will lead to physical and spiritual transformation in our hearts, our region and the nations.(Luke 18:7-8, Isa 62:6]]></description>

It can be any day of the week, any time of the day or night. As you walk into the room, the first thing that strikes you is a very tangible presence of the Lord, a presence that is increasingly touching the greater community. The beautiful worship music certainly contributes to the atmosphere as a popular worship chorus is extended to a 15 or 20 minute prophetic song and prayer. About a dozen people are scattered throughout the room either worshiping along with the band, or kneeling in prayer at a seat, or pacing the aisle way, praying. The singers up front alternate with one another, often harmonizing with one another?s spontaneous, prayerful lyrics as the musicians play. Every 15 minutes or so, a prayer leader reads one of the prayers of the Apostle Paul or a Psalm or another portion of scripture, then prays the scripture for the city of Ann Arbor and the region. You join your heart to the prayer and quietly amen each point of the prayer, gripped with a burden to see even a greater measure of the spiritual breakthrough that has already begun to hit this strategic city and region since this prayer meeting began. Today, it is the worship team of one of the area?s Korean churches that is providing the offering of music to the Lord. Yesterday when you came in, it was the worship team of one of the university churches. Last week, it was one of the other community churches that led in song. As the current song comes to a close, you see another team of worship leaders preparing to take over the next two hour shift which will begin the night watch that will go all night. This team consists of ?prayer missionaries? and musicians who have come from different parts of the country to focus on praying for the region for 6 months. Your heart swells with joy as you gratefully reflect on the great things God has done in unifying believers and transforming the community since the Intercessory Mission began. You were there when it was just one day each week. Then you were there when it grew to two days, three days, etc.. until today, where this kind of ?Harp and Bowl? prayer occurs 24/7]]></description>

"Throughout history we find that, at the darkest moments God has raised up praying companies emboldened with hope to stand in spiritual defiance in the present reality and call upon God until His government is established in the earth." - Unknown

"There are moments in history when a door for massive change opens and great revolutions for good or evil spring up in the vacuum created by these openings. In these divine moments, key men and women and even entire generations risk everything to become the hinge of history, the pivotal point that determines which way the door will swing." - Lou Engle

MISSION:
Our mission is to establish communities of day and night prayer and worship, which minister to Jesus, contend for breakthrough for spiritual awakening and justice, through fasting and prayer, and proclaim with demonstration the gospel of the kingdom to this generation. (JHOP National Website).

Vision:

The Kalamazoo House of Prayer (KHOP) seeks to be a 24-hour house of prayer and worship. We believe in the necessity for those who are followers of Jesus Christ to come together to pray. In this unity of prayer, we believe for an increased outpouring of the Holy Spirit even as the time of Christ?s return draws closer ? a sovereign outpouring that will produce a great harvest of souls as well as the spiritual and physical transformation of our region.

Core Values:

Unity of the Church
Establish a co-operative 24-hour house of prayer and worship in agreement with Jesus? prayer that the church would minister to God and our community as one. (John 17:20)
Celebrate prayer in agreement with, and worship of, Jesus ? manifest in the beauty of diverse streams of the Bible-believing Church of southwest Michigan coming together.
Respond to the call for the Church to be a ?house of prayer for all nations.? (Isaiah (56:7)
Night and Day Cry for Righteousness and Justice
Participate in God?s sovereign plan to restore night and day worship in the spirit of David?s tabernacle prior to the return of Jesus. (Amos 9:11, Luke 18:7)
Encourage the Church in a lifestyle of fasting, praying, giving, and serving ? striving to truly be the image of a bride for which Jesus is returning. (Matthew 6)
Stand firm in the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 2:15)
Contend for the peace of Jerusalem, that the city of Jesus? throne will be a praise in all the earth. (Isaiah 6]]></description>

We are a ministry whose desire is to prepare our region for the return of Jesus.  The return of Jesus is "great and very terrible" (Joel 2:11).  We are contending for a region that can stand and call others into the repentance that has always been required to prepare for the coming of Jesus!

Matthew 3:1-3  In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!" For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: "THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS: PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD; MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT. " 

Our main areas of ministry focus on partnering with Jesus in the rebuilding of Davids 24/7 worship movement that began in a tabernacle, reaching for the establishment of family unity in seeking the Lord, and contending for an individual expression of the value system of heaven laid out in the Sermon on the Mount.]]></description>

The ministry of Oasis House of Prayer (OHOP) has a 2-fold mandate?first vertical, second horizontal.<br /><br />Psalm 132:3-5 embodies the vow of the vertical ministry of Oasis ? ?Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, until I find a place for the Lord?a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.? OHOP is a place of habitation not just visitation for the Lord Jesus, both geographically and spiritually speaking.
<br /><br />
Secondly, OHOP is a refueling station or a watering hole for missionary intercessors and intercessory missionaries. In essence, the Oasis House of Prayer is a resting place for Jesus and His Bride.]]></description>

History of the Regional House of Prayer
In September 1998, Apostle Robert King, Senior Pastor of Harvest Christian Church for over 22 years, shared the vision that God had put in his heart: pioneer a ?House of Prayer? in the Detroit area giving local churches access to a special place set apart for worship and intercession.

This House began in an office trailer.  It was located on the property of Harvest Christian Church, but used by churches throughout the Metro area.  Pastors from area churches regularly gathered together to pray for the region, as well as sending teams to the House of Prayer to worship and pray.  God was impacting our region in a powerful way.  Participation at the House of Prayer trailer increased; we needed a new home.

A building on 7 Mile Road in northwest Detroit was purchased from a local church and has now become the Regional House of Prayer.  The vision is to have prayer for Detroit and the surrounding region 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  With the continued support of local pastors and their leaders, worship teams, prayer teams, dance teams and congregations, this vision can be fulfilled.  We can have prayer and worship coming before our Lord and King on behalf of the region!

In 2006, God began to expand the vision of the Metro Detroit Regional House of Prayer.  Expansion would come through developing a website with virtual prayer access.  What you see is that website.

How does this expand prayer over the Detroit region?  Through the virtual prayer website rhop.info you can logon anytime anywhere and strategically pray and worship concerning the city of Detroit, one of the many suburbs of Detroit, focus on regional economics, children, youth, schools, government and other specific areas.  You can pray from the comfort of your home, office, local coffee house, hotel, library, school ? anywhere there is internet access throughout the world.  Only have a few minutes?  It takes less than 10 minutes to pray through a module.  Have more time?  Pray through as many modules as you like]]></description>

PRAYER MINISTRY
Matthew 21:13 says, ?My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.? We know that the most important part of any building is the foundation and so it is with prayer in the life of the believer as well as the corporate body. At Rochester First Assembly we believe that prayer is not only the foundation, but also the building blocks to revival and continued growth in our walks with the Lord.

We invite you to be a part of the following intercessory prayer opportunities:

Daily Prayer ? Tuesday ? Thursday at 6:00 AM and Friday at 5:30 AM

Pre-Service Prayer ? Sundays at 8:00 AM

Intercessory Prayer ? Mondays at 7:00 PM and Thursdays at 10:00 AM

Harp & Bowl ? An extended time of praise, worship and prayer. Every other Friday at 7:30 PM

24 Hour Prayer ? Friday at 5:30 AM ? Saturday at 5:30 AM on Harp & Bowl weekend]]></description>

In April of 2007, Strait Gate House of Prayer held it?s first meetings at the local High School of Indian River, Mi. with people from 3 different counties and a variety of Church affiliations. Everyone came to worship the Lord and to pray. After two months of meeting in the High School, we approached The Arch Ministries who was occupying the former Indian River United Methodist Church at 3228 Gatewood Ave, Indian River to see if we could come twice a month to pray in the building. This was accepted with open arms from all on the board. So in June of 2007, we began meeting with around 30+ to worship and pray for our communities in the region. We continued to meet twice a month until January of 2008 when we began to meet every Tuesday night. Our worship team represented five to six different churches in the area. Our times of prayer were filled with the presence of the Lord. Everyone was blessed by the unity of hearts as we lifted up the name of Jesus in song and in praise.

Over the past three years we saw several miraculous physical healings of those who attended the meetings. We have received testimonies of God?s loving hand on our communities business owners as they have struggled in these economic times. The Body of Christ, at large, have been blessed by our times of pray for their continued strength in these challenging days. More houses of prayer have also been encouraged by our special times of joint prayer during special events. You can sense the Lord?s great pleasure as we have joined together for one purpose: to seek His will in our land.

In Oct. 2008, Strait Gate House of Prayer assumed the sole responsibility of the building on Gatewood Ave. The United Methodist Church has a running lease with us in the hopes of our purchasing of the property in the near future.

In the month of July of 2009, we became a recognized 501c (3) organization. We have been blessed by those who have given of the time, talents, gifting and contributions to the work of Strait Gate House of Prayer]]></description>

THE PLAN OR STRATEGY ?You shall no longer be termed Forsaken Nor shall your land any more be termed Desolate; But you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; For the LORD delights in you, And your land shall be married.5 For as a young man marries a virgin,  So shall your sons marry you; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, So shall your God rejoice over you. 6 I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; They shall never hold their peace day or night. You who make mention of the LORD, do not keep silent,7 And give Him no rest till He establishes And till He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. [Isa 62:4-8]

Transformation Michigan will help energize the prayer movement in every region as it moves around our state]]></description>

Zion Church is a House of Prayer. 
Matthew 21:13 He said to them, The Scripture says, My house shall be called a house of prayer;

David established his throne in Zion as a prophetic declaration that eventually His Son, the Messiah, would reign in that exact place. In Davids time, Zion?s primary identity was the governmental seat for Davids throne. 

Once he established his political capital in Zion, David then used his authority to establish Zion as a seat for 24/7 worship to the Lord (1 Chronicles 25). David understood the pattern of worship in the heavenlies (Psalm 119:96). He observed that wherever Gods throne is established there is incessant worship arising before Him. To fulfill that divine pattern, David inaugurated 24/7 worship and prayer in the stronghold of Zion. That 24/7 house of prayer represented the worship and praise that will arise incessantly to Jesus when He returns to earth and places His throne in Zion. Davidic-style worship will continue in Zion forever.

Zion Troy Church seeks to establish that 24/7 house of prayer by offering physical prayer times, virtual prayer times, and its members continually seeking the Lord face in their own homes.  

The following are our physical times for prayer: 
Tuesdays 12:30 Intercession 
Wednesday nights are dedicated to Harp and Bowl worship and prayer. 7:00 PM
Thursdays 12:30 Intercession 
Preservice Prayer: 8:30-9:30 Chapel; 9:30-10:00 Sanctuary]]></description>

Bethany is a place where the missions movement and the prayer movement converge. Bethany House of Prayer, a ministry of Bethany College of Missions, exists to gather, train, and equip a generation of lovesick worshipers first to love God and to take the love of God and the testimony of Christ to every nation. We believe that the Lord is orchestrating a global prayer movement that will release the greatest apostolic witness and the greatest harvest history has ever seen, preparing the way for the Lord Jesus to return to the earth to rule and reign in partnership with His Bride, the Church. Because of this we at BHOP are committed to the establishment of night and day prayer in our region, and all across the globe. We believe the highest privilege of humanity is to partner with God in His plan of redemption for the world. May the Lord Jesus receive the reward of His suffering]]></description>

Burn 24-7: Central Minnesota exists to exalt the name of Jesus in collaboration with the gathered regional churches. We contend for the way of the Kingdom through prayer and actively host the presence of God, believing that his presence has the power to shift the outcome and resources of our hearts, of our city and the global community. We are a birthing place for creativity, passion, and freedom to bring the Kingdom into every area of life and every corner of the world.

Our vision as Burn 24-7: Central Minnesota is to be the connection that draws a divided church together under the single banner of the name of Jesus. We provide a consistent place for all people to encounter Gods presence in the context of consistent co-hosted worship and prayer, artistic expressions, local ministry, and regional equipping.]]></description>

We exist to stand in agreement with the heart of God.  Through worship we will agree that He alone is God and through intercession we will agree with the desires of His heart. From this place of agreement, we will intercede for the Church as she prepares for the physical return of Jesus, our Bridegroom God. In intimate partnership with our Beloved, we will ask Him to move in the Elk River area & beyond, that He would draw all people to Himself in love]]></description>

About UMHOP

We believe that God desires to establish a sustained and unified worship, prayer, and mobilization movement at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, a movement that will have global impact.

This is not about a particular organization. In fact, far from it!?we encourage everyone to remain plugged into their current campus ministry or local church body. UMHOP is about joining together as one, as brothers and sisters in Christ, unified around our common desire to see God move in our own life and in the lives of those around us. We believe that as we corporately worship the Almighty God, humble ourselves in the place of prayer before our Advocate Jesus Christ, and respond in obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit, all in the place of unity, we will see the campus?and the Twin Cities and beyond?reached like never before for the glory of God.

This is a time for intercessors to arise and join forces to cry out for God?s purposes to be fulfilled in this hour. There is a stirring that is taking place. God is calling His people to join together to pray, to worship, and to reach the lost and broken. Are you responding to the ca]]></description>

About

Calling

?you will do the work of David and Solomon in one generation? you will worship and lead many into worship?? [Excerpt from a prophetic word given by Jane Williams in February 2004]

Bethany House of Prayer is called to, 24/7 worship unto God. God?s pattern for this house of prayer is in the likeness of the tent of David. God is restoring worship as stated in Amos 9:11 ? In that day I will raise up the fallen tent [booth] of David.? As we agree with Him, ?His will be done on earth as it is in heaven?, the replication of Heavenly Worship around His Throne, never ending never ceasing, will be established here on earth before He returns for His bride. Bethany House of Prayer is committed to partner with God and are devoted to give Him all the glory and honor and praise for He is worthy.

On Earth

Practically speaking we are to equip, train, raise, and send the saint?s for the ministry. The desire of Bethany House of Prayer is to identify musicians and singers as purified, sanctified, consecrated vessels unto God, to stand in a place of worship. Ministering to God by pouring out their oil of adoration, exultation, and praise unto Him with love songs from their heart. To respond to God?s Heart with intimacy and prayer]]></description>

CrossRoads International House of Prayer is a four state area-wide interdenominational prayer ministry, serving the body of Christ for the past 7 years. This ministry is modeled after the Tabernacle of David with singers and musicians being released to lead corporate intercession and worship.  Our desire is not to be a church; it is to be a prayer center that is open to as many hours as possible in order to cover our region with corporate prayer.

    We have started with small beginnings and are confident that this ministry will grow until a 24-hour House of Prayer and Worship is established, where we can gaze upon the beauty of Jesus day and night.  It is also our plan to establish three healing rooms where the sick can come and get prayer then sit and soak in the presence of the Lord.

    Our facility is located at 4715 E. Newman Rd, Joplin, MO 64801, by MSSU campus.  For a map and directions to our facility, visit our Location page.  

    Our property has 2 buildings on 5 acres, with a nice pond with shrubbery and wildflowers surrounding two sides.  We have plans to build a prayer path around the pond and perimeter of the property with places for people to walk, pray, meditate or simply enjoy the beauty of God?s creation.  God has given us the opportunity to be expressive in our prayers and worship to Hi]]></description>

At the Gateway House of Prayer St. Louis our primary goal is nothing less than seeing the fullness of Gods rule and will established in the earth. At GHOP-STL, we are trying, in the grace of God, to establish a place of 24 hour a day, 7 day a week, non-stop worship and prayer. We are inviting any Christian fellowship in the St. Louis area to join with us. We desire GHOP-STL to be a unified, city-wide voice that cries out night and day before the Throne of God for the coming of His Kingdom and the fulfillment of His will in St. Louis]]></description>

As God has given us an I-35 roadmap (Isaiah 35)for the Northland of Kansas City Mo it is our desire to partner with many congregations to strenghthen the feeble hands and weak knees. To build a "highway of holiness" with a company of lovesick worshippers to see a wilderness change into a delightful garden! Please join us each Sunday from 5pm-10pm.

What is the World Network of Prayer? 
The World Network of Prayer is a center for receiving and distributing prayer needs among our fellowship. It is to provide the prayer agenda for producing the power of agreement. It also serves as a resource center for individuals as well as local church prayer leaders.


The World Network of Prayer?s office is at the World Evangelism Center in Hazelwood, Missouri, where prayer requests are received by telephone, mail, website or e-mail. The requests are then included on a weekly prayer request list that goes to over 5,000 prayer warriors/groups.
Since WNOP was introduced in 1995, it has distributed over a million prayer guides and now has 131 national prayer coordinators and 45 district coordinators.
 
Who is the World Network of Prayer?
In addition to leaders and intercessors who receive our weekly and urgent requests, the World Network of Prayer staff includes Flo Shaw, WNOP?s International Coordinator and Lisa Marshall, WNOP?s Strategic Prayer Coordinator]]></description>

The Holy Spirit is orchestrating a worldwide movement, bringing His people into lifestyles of wholeheartedness through globally united worship and intercession. Our vision is to build a place where a community of believers embraces this corporate mandate and individuals choose a daily lifestyle based upon the Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5-7, Rev 22:17).]]></description>

Though from different backgrounds and denominations, they came united with one central goal?to partner with the Lord in building a house of prayer in the Jackson area.  Armed with little more than hungry hearts and a vision of what is to come, we curbed our impatience to see instant results and stayed in a season of hiddenness, allowing the Spirit to establish our foundation]]></description>

Welcome to the Burn Bozeman !
A gathering of worshipers and intercessors pursuing the heart of God for the city of Bozeman.
-Psalms 34:1-4

Why we Burn in Bozeman, MT
Most of us are familiar with the recent popular book called The Shack. In it?s pages we see the perfect analogy of how the Presence of God the father, Jesus the Christ and the Holy Spirit, transform an environment to perfection and beauty. The shack, which is formerly a place of tragedy, death and pain is transformed into a place of life, restoration, healing and revelation. This happens because the presence of God inhabits every corner of it?s atmospheric space. No death can remain in the presence of God.

In Bozeman, a city nestled into the Bridger?s, under the beautiful big sky, we already behold the beauty of God?s creation daily. All of the nature in our surrounding cries out, ?glory to the King?. We are blessed to live in the ?last best place?. How much more beauty and appeal will our city have, after a throne has been built in love (Isaiah 16:5), to the King and he finds a resting place. We long for him to inhabit our praises, thus changing our atmosphere from death and religion to the ultimate abundance of life!

We long with a passion to see the dividing lines of denominations and offenses to be wiped away, a place where with true unity, we can exalt the name of the Lord together. The theme verse for the Gallatin Valley is Romans 15:5-6]]></description>

This is your invitation to spend some peaceful, quite time alone (or with a friend) praying and seeking the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart.

The Deep Creek Prayer Retreat is located at the end of a county road approximately 30 minutes from town in Missoula, Montana. Our mission is to provide a place of prayer and retreat for individuals and small groups (maximum of 25-30 people).

We are a Christian retreat. The facilities consist of 2 houses built in 2000: The Main House which has 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a beautiful garden room, larger living/dining area and complete kitchen. See pictures of the facility here. The Guest House consists of two studio-type units named CREEKSIDE and MEADOW . Each unit has a living area, kitchenette, separate sleeping area and bathroom with shower. The kitchenette has sink, small fridge, microwave and coffee-maker but no full cooking facilities. These studio units have two single beds and a queen size futon sleeper-sofa in each unit. Download driving directions, brochures and pictures here.

In both the main house and guest house everything is provided except: bedding and bath towels. We ask that groups use the facility and then leave it cleaner than you found it?thanks

We do not charge a set fee for use, but we do have suggested donations. Please call for details]]></description>

About Us
Appalachian House of Prayer is comprised of people who hear the Fathers cry for a praying people. ?God needs praying people?! Our nation is in moral decline and its pulling our families & congregations down with it. If ever their were a need for the Church to be awakened it?s now. Jesus is coming back for a spotless bride who is in expectation of His return. She will have labored in prayer for the reward that He is worthy of. Prayer is like the plow that breaks up the fallow ground of our society allowing the seed of Gods Word to take root in the heart?s of it?s people.
We are praying that the Father?s love will manifest in the heart of the Church that She may endure the judgement that comes upon Her (1 Peter 4:17). The Father?s love will heal Her & set Her free from the blindness of religion that She may lead those held captive by sin to the one who died for all mankind. Now that is the power of a praying Church.
If you feel His heart?come let us seek the Lord together while He may be found and call upon Him while He is near (Isaiah 55:6)]]></description>

IHOP Concord opened its doors on November 16th 2007 to be a 24/7 house of prayer for the church in Concord. We are committed to helping rebuild the broken tabernacle of David, Amos 9:11, which is night and day worship and prayer. It is in this intimate place with the Lord that we will find our dream of God and dream in God for ourselves and our city. We are located in Concords historical town hall of 1885 at 62 Union Street South. We invite you to join us in His Presence.

To awaken the Bride of Christ in our city to the goodness, love and reality of Jesus through day and night worship and intercession and a life of devotion to Him.

We believe the Holy Spirit is orchestrating this worldwide movement as a fulfillment of the Fathers desire that His House would be called a House of Prayer and that it would be filled with Joy (Isaiah 56:7). This movement will usher in the end time global harvest and reach a crescendo before the Lord returns; as the bowls of intercession become full in Heaven (Rev. 5:8).

The House of Prayer in Concord is voluntarily "staffed" by the Church in Concord and is open for the whole city and region to come in and experience the presence of God.

We are looking for an army of voluntary lovers (Ps 110) of God who will help rebuild the broken tabernacle of David (Amos 9:11) in Concord]]></description>

There is a movement of intercession and worship sweeping across this nation and Durham, NC is catching the wave! If you have a passion for God and a passion for prayer, then you are invited to attend an interest meeting happening on Saturday June 27, 2015 at Starbucks on Guess Rd. There will be a brief moment of prayer, but this will mainly be a time of information and any questions or concerns you may have. A prayer furnace is a place where believers of all different denominations can come together on a consistent basis and intercede on behalf of our city and nation. I am so stoked for what God is doing and will do in this city. Come and be apart of watching the presence and power of God flip our city and nation upside down for His glory through the prayers of the righteous! Cant wait to see you there!]]></description>

We are longing to see 24/7 prayer and worship raised up in Asheville and the surrounding region in the spirit of the tabernacle of David as prophesied in Amos 9:11-15 and to provide a place for the Body of Christ in our region to encounter Jesus in the place of worship and prayer]]></description>

The Wilmington Prayer Furnace is a ministry of continual prayer and worship driven by a relational community seeking to gather and contend for the habitation of God. We exist to equip people into the fullness of their gifting and calling while contending for spiritual breakthrough in our city. We exist to pursue a lifestyle of wholehearted devotion, prayer and fasting while leading lives that reflect the nature and character of God and release the Kingdom of God in the earth.

Prayer Room
The purpose of the prayer room is to usher people into a lifestyle of prayer and worship, providing an atmosphere for personal cultivation and relationship with the Lord. Through the beholding of his face this individual cultivation establishes the body as a corporate call of continual prayer. The open door invitation serves to gather the city to this calling, to come as they are before the Lord and enter into His presence.

Daily Sets
The Prayer Room will function around a musical model of two-hour sets. The teams vary in size from one person on an instrument to full worship teams. There are three types of sets: devotional, worship with the word, and intercession.

Devotional: Worship set for personal reflection and study. It is a time for seeking his face, through the cultivating of his word by the spirit of wisdom and revelation.
Worship with the Word: Worship set focused around a specific passage of scripture, which the singers expound on throughout the set.
Intercession: This two-hour set is based around a model using both prayer and music; generally, there is a specific focus. During this time there is a prayer facilitator working in coordination with the music team, leading the room from a mic, different people may come up to the mic and pray from the mic during the times. We will lead rest of the room to engage with the prayer.
Weekly Meetings
Tuesday night Encounter God Service (EGS) includes corporate worship, impartation, teaching and ministry. This meeting will be an introduction to the prayer furnace format.
Friday night worship (Fire On the Altar) is led by young leaders with a fiery vision for revival in their city and awakening on their campuses. This night has a primary focus on college age and young adults but all are welcome to join.]]></description>

We see prayer as our primary mission. Second (but with great importance as well) are the teaching messages we offer.

We are an Amos 9:11 movement]]></description>

There is always a lot going on at HOPE Center, and central to everything is our prayer room, which is currently open to the public 16 hours a week. The prayer room has been designed to reflect the spirit of the tabernacle of David (1 Chr. 22?24); it is a place where we never cease worshiping the Lord and interceding for the nations of the earth. Each prayer slot is guided by one of three prayer formats: intercession, devotion and/or worship with the Word.
We want you to feel comfortable whether as a participant or an anonymous visitor. You are welcome to stay in the prayer room as long as you like. While in the prayer room, feel free to sing along with the worship teams, read your Bible, study a favorite commentary, write in your journal, or just pray. You may sit, stand, or even pace up and down the aisles. Whatever you do, we ask that you do it in a manner that honors God and serves the other people in the room]]></description>

Establishing a house of prayer in the city of Omaha to exalt Jesus night and day in the spirit of the tabernacle of David.

The house of prayer is a gathering place where we can corporately engage with God and partner with Him in prayer. We believe that worship and intercession are key ways that God chooses to release power to change hearts, our city and the nations.  God said that in the last days He would rebuild the tabernacle of David (Amos 9:11) and that from every region incense would arise (Malachi 1:11). Therefore we desire to see worship and prayer 24/7 arising from the city of Omaha!]]></description>

Omaha HUB DISTINCTIVES
 
We operate as a wheel within a wheel ? representing different parts of the church moving together as God speaks to us, propelling us forward to advance the kingdom of God upon the earth in this hour.
 
The HUB is comprised of spoke ministries that carry a forerunning Spirit ? each spoke consists of a ministry that equips the body in some way ? preparing the Bride for the coming of Christ.
 
Our wheel will always turn from a Malachi 4 mandate? working with the Spirit to reconcile fathers, sons etc. bringing the generations together.  Each spoke brings a piece of God?s heart that turn the wheel through equipping for ministry, worship, prayer, feeding the poor and outreach!]]></description>

Intimacy with Jesus
 	Intimacy with Jesus is our ultimate reward and calling
 	 
 	24/7 Worship and Prayer
 	With an unending chorus of worship and ceaseless prayer, we desire to minister to the Lord day and night and to cry out for ?speedy justice? (Luke 18) from one geographical location. In essence, our desire is to move beyond normal prayer meetings to inspire and nurture a culture of prayer (Isaiah 56:7).	
 	 
 	The Scriptures: The Word of God
 	The Bible is the eternal (Matt 24:35), infallible (Psalm 12:6), unhindered (2 Tim 2:9), and inspired (2 Timothy 3:16) Word of God and as such, we desire to search out the Scriptures to better understand them and apply them to our lives.	 
 	 
 	Unity of the Body
 	At the foundation of the Prayer Furnace we felt the Lord lead us into intercession for the Church based on the words of Jesus to His people (Revelation 2-3). The power of any lasting move of God will only be sustained if we are unified, and then the blessing will come (Psalm 133). Our endeavor is to see us ?all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ? (Ephesians 4:13)	 
 	 
 	Prayer for Leaders and Authorities
 	Interceding ?for kings and all those in authority? (1Timothy 2:1-3) is a priority. We desire to bless our leaders and pray that righteousness will exalt our nation (Prov 14:34)	 
 	 
 	Consecrated Lifestyle
 	Like John the Baptist, we desire to live a fasted lifestyle because of our devotion to the Bridegroom, Jesus. Thus, we voluntarily refuse the legitimate pleasures of this world (Numbers 6) for the extreme pleasure of knowing God (Psalm 16). This passion for Jesus is born not of legalism, but out of lov]]></description>

"Prayer is not overcoming Gods reluctance, but laying hold of His willingness." - Martin Luther

The Vision:
1. To call forth, train, and mobilize intercessors to live a life of prayer as they preach the gospel, heal the sick, help the needy, make disciples, and seek to bring transformation to society; to make it our aim to personally live as fully devoted disciples of Jesus, who operate in the forerunner spirit.

2. To establish a gathering corporately to fast and pray, because we recognize this as essential to establishing justice in society.

3. To train others to plant houses of prayer, churches, and/or marketplace ministries as the Spirit leads.]]></description>

The Pinnacle Mountain is 89 acres of wooded hilltop nestled in the beautiful town of Sutton, NH.  The name "the Pinnacle" was given to this property long before we arrived and it can be seen as such on various maps, although it remains a mystery to us how it received this name. The Pinnacle is not the highest hill in the area, though from its summit one can see neighboring Kearsarge Mt. and Mt. Monadnock (near Keene, NH).  The Pinnacle, we now know, is significant for other reasons.

All throughout scripture God chose mountains- some small and some large- to move upon and make Himself known to His people. All creation has been designed by God with purpose. We believe the purpose of the Pinnacle is to be a sanctuary for God and a light house for the nation. It is not the only one, but a significant one. A light house guides people to a safe place. In this case, it is guiding people to the house of God. 

 
The Pinnacle is a thin place- a section of land where it seems that the heavens are closer than in other places. For many years this was exploited as the local witchcraft community used the Pinnacle for their rituals.  Even they understood it was a significant and supernatural place.  Therefore, when we took ownership of the land the occult members were not happy. They tore down the cross we had placed on the top and constantly set up their unholy altars. On the other hand, we kept tearing down their altars and over time, took this high place back.  We have had no sign of the occult for many years now.

Now, we see God releasing the Pinnacle into its purpose. Weve known its purpose for several years, but today, we are beginning to see that purpose come about! We now have prayer and worship services on the Mountain five nights a week and are also holding our Sunday morning services there.  We have already been given new insights and perspectives on prayer and worship and we believe that as we give attention to the Pinnacle, more will come]]></description>

S-HOP (Shore House of Prayer) is a place where any and all can gather to meet with God, bringing both their love and their needs to him, listening to hear his voice, and resting in his presence.

At the heart of S-HOP are worship teams appointed both day and night to bring worship and prayer together before God, modeled after the tabernacle of David (1 Chr. 16-25) and the worship in heaven (Rev. 4; 5) This means that, in our times before the Lord, we carry both the harp (worship) and the bowls of incense (prayer), because something amazing happens when these two join. And as with Israel in the time of King David, the long-term vision of S-HOP is to have worship and prayer going on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week]]></description>

Fire By Night is a network of simple churches (we call them Fire Houses) whose mission is to be the church rather than ?have? church. Fire Houses are small communities that focus on practicing the ?one anothers? of the bible and the simplicity of following Jesus. We have Fire Houses in various locations in the Silver City area and the WNMU campus. We also have a larger weekend gathering on Sunday afternoons at 4:00PM at Barnard Hall on the WNMU campus. These gatherings focus on celebration, worship, equipping, and helping people connect to our community]]></description>

Jesus severely rebuked the people of God for failing to be a house of prayer for all nations (Mark 11: 17; Isaiah 56:7).
Grace City is becoming known for our emphasis on being a house of prayer for all nations by building a prayer culture and creating a prayer movement that will impact an entire city. We practice Word-fed, Spirit-led, and Worship-based corporate prayer Monday through Thursday from 9 to 10:30am. We also worship and pray together on Sunday mornings from 9:45-10:15 AM. Last week, we added an 11 to 11:30am session on the campus of UNLV. This week we will hold nightly sessions from 7 to 8:15 PM. Currently, two dozen people join us daily to give thanks, read the Word, pray it back to God, worship, listen to God, confess sin, proclaim God?s kingdom and authority, pray for one another, and intercede for our city.
No two prayer sessions are alike because they are led by a leader or leaders who are listening to the Holy Spirit and trying to follow His lead. As a result, people have been saved, healed, and delivered from strong demons during our prayer times.
We have come to understand that everything we do should be done in the atmosphere of the presence of God and flow from our lives of prayer. It is through daily worship and prayer that we are able to live God-centered lives and cooperate with Jesus in building a God-centered church in Sin City that can kick down the gates of Hell (Matthew 16:18-20; Matthew 18:18-20]]></description>

Now you can connect with other believers throughout our State (& in your region, county or city) and begin to share with them in various ways (i.e., live chat, photos, videos, websites and documents), plan & host various planning and prayer events (for your region, county or city) and form various types of groups with the united purpose of mobilizing Prayer for the next National Day of Prayer.

The First Step is to join your Region, County and/or City Group (if you havent done so already), so that you can meet with other believers for prayer (at a local coffee shop, restaurant or home) or plan & take a prayer-drive (throughout your region, county or city). Within your group, you can send messages to the entire group and participate in online group discussions and then go to the Events Page, to post an Event and invite others to join you (who will then RSVP so that you can track who is, who is not and who may be coming). As you pray together, God will begin to show you even more ways to pray for your City, County, Region, State & America.

The Second Step is to post "prayer" Photos & Videos that would be an encouragement to other believers, as well as start state-wide, region-wide, county-wide & city-wide discussions on the Forum page about your prayer life and how God has changed your life & community through prayer. Begin to testify to the power of prayer and what God has done in response to your obedience to Him!

The Third Step is to Invite other believers that you already know, who have a passion for praying for America. After they have accepted your invitation to become a member of this online community, encourage them to also become an official National Day of Prayer Coordinator for your Region, County, City and/or Church & to post their local event on our national website, so that others throughout your community will know about it. You will also discover even more Information & Resources at our national website that have been prepared to help you pray for America!]]></description>

Currently, the Brooklyn House of Prayer conducts monthly watches. These watches are called The Tabernacle of David and employ harp and bowl worship and intercession. King David built a special tabernacle in Jerusalem to house the Ark of the Covenant (1 Chronicles 15:1; 16:1) He organized 4,000 musicians and 288 singers to minister to God before the Ark in shifts that continued 24 hours a day (1 Chronicles 6:31-33; 15:16-22; 23:4-6).
 
The Holy Spirit is orchestrating a global prayer strategy in these days and it is a new prayer paradigm. It is characterized by joy (Isaiah 56:7) and will be sustained 24 hours a day. We are seeing Houses of Prayer springing up in our nation and around the world. Many are already moving in 24/7 worship and intercession. This is the future of the Brooklyn House of Prayer, as well]]></description>

IHOP-LI: The Ark House of Prayer (affectionately referred to as TheArkHoP-LI) is first and foremost our love offering to God, communicated through our worship, prayer and deeds of mercy.  Each are life-giving expressions of our desire for Him. TheArkHoP-LI is expressed as a regional intercessory mission base that (we pray) carries a sincere and unpretentious heart before the Lord in worship-filled prayer. We deeply desire to grow into a community of fiery hearts who are zealous for HIM, His Glory and His Kingdom. He is the prize! We are committed to exploring every facet of Him as we work together to establish an altar of worship-filled prayer that continues to exalt Him night and day until He returns]]></description>

Situated near downtown Syracuse, we are a Torah observant fellowship with emphasis on informal atmosphere, and a balance between personal sharing and an open discussion on the weekly Torah reading.

We pursue, publish and proclaim the Wisdom of G-d in addition to embracing our biblical and cultural Jewish heritage as a witness to the faithfulness of G-d.

Join us every Friday evening at 7 PM as we celebrate Shabbat and Shabbat afternoon at 2 PM for our Torah study.

We will announce special days and times to meet on the Holy Days in celebrating the Biblical Feasts.

The best part of us is that we DO NOT have any official connection with any branch of Judaism or ministry groups. We are a community always desiring to fellowship with Jews and Gentiles who love G-d, our Jewish brothers and the land of Israel. 

Kehillat HaDerech YHVH: Personal, Heartfelt and Torah observant but you have to join us at the meeting place or e-shul to find out for yourself.]]></description>

JHOP-NYC was birthed out of The Call which saw massive amounts of young and old gather together for solemn assemblies of fasting and prayer in the spirit of Joel 2:15-17. In June 2002, Lou Engle launched The Call New York City. In every city a House of Prayer was to be raised up.

We are a community of young and old alike, joining the generations for the purpose of lifting up a continuous (24/7) cry of worship and intercession for New York City and this nation]]></description>

The Rockland House of Prayer, or RockHOP, meets the 2nd and 4th Sunday of the month 7:30pm-9:30pm. 
     We are interceding for revival in Rockland County, unity among the churches, genuine repentance and a hunger for the Word of God. 
     We do this through times of silent prayer, sharing what we received in prayer, harp and bowl style worship and intercession and small group prayer. 
     All are welcome!  If you have any interest please do not hesitate to contact me or just come by :) 
     Blessin]]></description>

The Cincinnati House of Prayer is a cross-denominational community of believers that exists to provide a place for lovesick worshipers to pour out their hearts in prayer and worship to God on behalf of themselves, their community, city, country and world. It?s a place where the first commandment, to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, is put into practice, resulting in outward expressions of loving your neighbor as yourself. At C-HOP, we are trying, in the grace of God, to establish a place where prayer and worship continue non-stop. We are inviting any Christian fellowship in the Cincinnati area to join with us. We desire to see a unified, citywide voice that reaches before God asking for His Kingdom and His will to come to this city and region. In so doing, the ?justice? promised in Luke 18 will be realized quickly.]]></description>

Why CoHOP?


Vision:


To build onto the Lord a 24/7 House of Prayer (prayer, revival, and justice center) after the order of the Tabernacle of David, where intercessory worship will ascend night and day onto the Throne Room of God until He makes Columbus, OH a praise in the earth. (Lk 18:6; Is 56:7; Is 62:6; Acts 15:15, Rev 8)

Objectives:
- To unite the Church of Jesus Christ in Columbus OH through Prayer/Intercession to return and fulfill the first and great commandment, thus being truly empowered to fulfill the second commandment. (Ps 133;

- To see a true Holy Ghost awakening and revival in the city, causing the young and the old to become fascinated and captivated by the awesome beauty of the Lord through intimate worship and intercession.

- To see the harvest of souls in our communities, especially in the Muslim community of our city through intercession and works of justice so that the Lamb that was slain will receive the reward of His suffering

- To effectively and adequately prepare the Church for the Second coming of our Bridegroom King through intimate worship, prayer, and teaching on Jesus? Endtime battle plan for His bride]]></description>

If...my people, my God-defined people, respond by humbling themselves, praying,
seeking my presence, and turning their backs on their wicked lives, Ill be there ready for you: Ill listen from heaven, forgive their sin and restore their land to health.

From now on Im alert day and night to the prayers offered in this place.

Who We Are

The Greater Toledo House of Prayer is an intercessory based ministry where individual believers and church teams commit two hours weekly to an assigned time, for the purpose of prayer and worship. Meetings are focused on touching the Fathers heart to unlock the door to His presence. We believe the spiritual climate of our region will only be changed under the banner of unity. The church together on her knees in true repentance, will lead to revival that will transform a city and many cities transformed, will transform a nation. 

GTHOP is a ministry serving the Greater Toledo Area. The vision is to be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for any person or group desiring to come and worship/pray His Kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. We are asking God to fulfill His promise and give the nations of the earth to Jesus as His inheritance. Come and join us as we seek breakthrough, city transformation, and revelation of Jesus Christ in the earth]]></description>

VISION STATEMENT:

To raise up a generation of worshipping intercessors and prophetic, anointed messengers who give themselves in a lifestyle of devoted intimacy with Jesus to advance Christs Kingdom through revival in the Church and a great harvest of souls among the nations.

 




The Prayer Room is the heart and soul of Restoration House Ministries International.  Our times of corporate intercessory worship are designed to reflect the pattern of the Tabernacle of David (1 Chronicles 22-24).  Our ultimate goal is to come to the place where the worship and intercession of the prayer room continues night and day (24/7) without ceasing.

The prayer room is designed primarily for corporate intercession.  While an intercessor may pray for any burden God has placed on their heart, you will find us consistently praying for:

Renewal for pastors and ministry leaders
Revival in city/regional churches
Transformation of our city/region
City, State and National Government leaders
Fruitful evangelism locally and among the nations
Youth to be raised up as a unique "Forerunner" generation
Justice issues (abortion; ethnic reconciliation; human trafficking, etc.)
Israel
Unity in the Body of Christ
Healing for the sick
Participants may actively engage in these times of energetic intercession by singing along with the worship team, by praying on the microphone for a corporate burden which may involve our region or believers worldwide, by praying a short 30-45 second prayer along with numerous others during one of our "rapid fire prayer" cycles focused on a specific theme and/or by praying with others who may wish to participate in a small group prayer time.

Visitors and participants may choose to be in the prayer room to read their Bible, study, write in a journal or quietly pray while immersed in an atmosphere of worship.  While in the prayer room you may sit, stand or pace in the back. However you engage, we simply ask that it be done in a manner that honors and serves the other people in the room]]></description>

The vision is simple really. A campus transformed. We want to see the Ohio state university turned upside down with the kingdom of Jesus ? the life of Jesus. We want to see the church of Jesus ? God?s people ? alive and active. A body unified in prayer and mission, living love loud for the renown of their God and King.]]></description>

WHAT IS OHOP?

The Ohio House of Prayer is a non-denominational network of people and ministries that are members of the Body of Christ dedicated to honoring Christ and His Church.  We believe that as members of His Body we are privileged to serve our Lord, as the Head, and His extraordinarily diverse Body; the Church.

OUR MISSION:

To network the Prayer Movement in Ohio for the purpose of advancing God?s Kingdom and bringing transformation to all generations through 24/7 prayer and justice.

WHY PRAY?

The simple answer is that Jesus is worthy! King David was a man after God?s own heart. How did he express that? One major way was that David commanded the Ark of the Covenant to be placed in a tent and appointed 4,288 singers and musicians to minister before the Lord, ?to make petition, to give thanks and to praise the Lord? day and night (1 Chronicles 15:1-17:27). The Bible says the end times will be characterized by the restoration of the Tabernacle of David (Amos 9:11). We believe and have seen God doing just that. All across the world (and in Ohio) there is an unprecedented prayer revival sweeping every nation. Virtually every major city has a house of prayer

About OHRPN

Welcome to the Ohio Reformation Prayer Network, a division of the United States Reformation Prayer Network
The United States Reformation Prayer Network was birthed through prophetic intercession. Cindy Jacobs, an internationally known and respected prophetic voice in our generation has been seeking the Lord for direction on how we as the Body of Christ are to disciple nations in these exciting times we are living in. Last September, she heard the Lord speak to her about picking up the strategic prayer network again. On the very same day, Chuck Pierce, who had been leading the US Global Apostolic Prayer Network, heard the Lord say to him to lay down the prayer network! 

We are both thrilled and honored to be working with the national leadership of the United States Reformation Prayer Network as we coordinate and facilitate these national objectives at the state level. In addition to Cindy Jacobs, the Ohio Reformation Prayer Network will also be working closely with Chuck Pierce and Dutch Sheets. Working under this national leadership will provide a strong 3-fold cord that will allow us to stand strong in unity and authority in order to effectively intercede for reformation in our state and nation]]></description>

The Cleveland House Of Prayer is a city-wide prayer ministry in Greater Cleveland. Our mission and purpose is to build enjoyable prayer meetings that eventually become 24/7 in operation. We will accomplish this by gathering teams of intercessors and worshipers from Greater Cleveland and situate them into two-hour prayer slots, one after the other. God deserves prayer and worship that is unending. God receives unceasing praise in heaven. He hears and enjoys Clevelands worship also, and soon it will be never ending]]></description>

24/7 House Of Prayer
General Information
We are committed to prayer, worship, the Scriptures, healing, prophecy, fasting and the Great Commission. It is through night and day prayer that evangelism will be most effective as we believe God to fulfill the Great Commission. We want to train up a generation to stand in the midst of persecution and boldly proclaim the Word of God]]></description>

God has made us to be Priest.(Revelation 1:6&Revelation 5:10&1Peter 2:9)we are not priest who minister to carnal men, but who minister to God in the Holy Place.God is rebuilding the tabernacle of David (Amos 9:11&Acts 15:16&17). This means He is again establishing Day and Night Prayer accompanied by singers and musicians. God is raising up His Church as a Holy Spirit empowered worship and prayer movement as his first line of defense against the demonic prayer movement in the last days(Rev 13). As the church comes into agreement with who Jesus is and what He is going to do, the worship and intercession of the saints in the End Times will release God?s judgment against the Anti-Christ?s world empire and usher in the second coming of Jesus, and the establishing of His Millennial Kingdom from Jerusalem. It will be the most powerful and effective Revolution in history (Rev. 22:17; 5:8;8:4; Lk. 18:7-8; Ps.29; 149; Isa. 24:14-16; 26:8-9; 42:10-13; 62:6-7; Joel 2:12-17, 32; Zeph.2:1-3 etc.) THIS IS NOT CHURCH BUSINESS AS USUAL!!!]]></description>

Each month we gather together at our World Prayer Center to pursue the heart of God and call forth the things of Heaven. We call these nights "Pursuit Nights". The World Prayer Center is a building located at Victory Christian Center near Youngstown, Ohio. The prayer center is also open every day 7am-9pm for anyone to come and have their personal prayer time. Everyone is welcome!

We meet every 3rd Friday of the month at 7pm. Join us!]]></description>

The heartbeat of EMBER is the gathered prayer & worship of the unified Church, giving people regular space to come and to meet with God; to gather with expectancy and to meditate and reflect on the goodness and the beauty of Jesus. We offer worship to God, while contending for justice and for the power of the Holy Spirit to be manifest and bring transformation in our city and region in a continual way.]]></description>

The Oklahoma City House of Prayer exists to provide a place for our city to encounter the Lord both in personal devotional time and corporate intercession as we join together to contend for our city, our nation, and the nations of the world. We welcome people across our city to come find a safe space, a sacred place to abide in the Lord in an atmosphere of prayer and worship.

Our desire at RHOP is to see 24-hour worship and intercession cover the city and change the spiritual atmosphere over Coweta and the surrounding region. We believe that people young and old from every background and nationality will come from around the world for short and long-term season of refreshing, impartation and revelation, and to make sure that the fire on the altar never goes out.]]></description>

God is calling those with a heart for prayer and the people of this state to pray day and night. He is inviting praying churches, praying families, houses of prayer, prayer furnaces, campus prayer rooms, marketplace gatherings, and small group gatherings to stand as watchman on the wall, worshipping God and asking Him to build up the Body of Christ and send revival to our state, as prayer rises 24/7 together across the state. 

Coming together day and night, exalting the name of Jesus, and calling out for righteousness and justice (Psalm 89:14, 97:2) in our state is simple. Separately we are a sweet smelling aroma and a hammer of Justice in our regions; together we will be an eternal memorial of exaltation declaring, "You are Holy - send swift Justice." Alone we are beautiful, but together we will be partners with Him in a Great Awakening]]></description>

Mission Statement
Bringing the body of Christ together in prayer to reclaim our communities for God; to effect and enforce God?s original plans and purposes for our cities and usher in the Righteousness of God and the end-time harvest of souls into His kingdom.

As intercessors we are servants to the body of Christ praying to God on behalf of the church. We pray primarily for the churches and pastors of Douglas County. Specifically, that they receive the honor, respect, courage and blessing they need to do the work of the ministry God has called them to accomplish in the community.

The purpose of a House of Prayer is to encourage, bless and support our communities and churches through prayer so they can be successful. We do this by bringing the body of Christ together in the heart of "one accord" prayer.

Psalm 133

Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, coming down upon the beard, even Aaron?s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his robes. It is like the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion; for there the lord commanded the blessing - life forever.

A City-wide, multidenominational, 24-hour worship and intercessory ministry to the body of Christ in Salem and the surrounding area. Our goal is to build a "corporate altar" of night and day prayer where we may stand before Jesus, unified and strengthened in our unyielding love for the worthy Son of Man. It?s a place where the first commandment, to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, is put into practice, resulting in outward expressions of loving your neighbor as yourself. The Salem House of Prayer is one focal point for the churches of the?city to come together in unity and pray for revival of our ministries and for the spiritual awakening of our communities to the Gospel of Jesus. We will continually cry out for God to visit our city and release a great awakened love for Jesus, a massive harvest of souls, for abundant signs and wonders, and a powerful spiritual movement among the youth. We are committed to a city-wide involvement of this ministry and ask that all staff and interns be involved in their local churches.]]></description>

My Ministry

Light-House Of Prayer Ministries:

Is a gathering of two or more people in Jesus name for the purpose of praying for, caring for, and sharing Christ with their neighbors and others in their sphere of influence. Essentially, believers pray for their neighbors by name, care for them through ministry, and share Jesus with them. Focused, consistent prayer among believers is the foundation for everything else that takes place.

Members are known by their first name and their absence is apparent at services. Each member is part of an emotional support group that protects each other from falling through the cracks. Family and friends celebrate happy events together and help each other out during tragic events.

Helping a neighbor in need is considered a more religious act than participating in complicated rituals.

Voice of the Bride is a relational ministry endeavoring to unite like-minded individuals who hear the call of Jesus to step out into deeper waters through their worship and intercession.

We gather area worship teams and intercessors to take a scheduled amount of time and lead that gathering in intercessory worship.

Do you feel called to extended times of worship and intercession; a longing to see the Tabernacle of David restored and worship continuing around the clock in South Western Pennsylvania ? we should get together. We are constantly looking for opportunities to network with like-hearted individuals.

We desire to see revival come and to see transformation of this city and the world. Transformation is about waging spiritual warfare and seeing the Church of Jesus Christ used as an instrument to shift the balance of power in that war. Its about seeing the Church exercising influence and authority through its life of holiness, love and compassion for a lost and dying world.

Transformation is about reaching a critical mass of believers who are so empowered by the gospel of Christ that they change everything they touch.

Feel free to contact us for more information or dive right into one of our gatherings and try the waters.]]></description>

Abba Father is the Head of this House and ministry. We are building a " Living Throne" of Praise, Prayer, Worship and Intercession. It is to become continuous night and day; " to pray without ceasing" ( 24hrs./7days ). He hungers to mingle with his people. Abba will be enthroned in all His majesty, power and splendor. When His Glory comes down, it will fill the temple; then flow out like a river into the streets. ( 1Thes. 5:16, Rev. 7:15, 22:3-5, Ps. 108:5, Ps. 84:10-12, Ps. 113: 148-150 ]]></description>

Forerunner House of Prayer

 The Holy Spirit is orchestrating a global prayer strategy in these last days, it is a new paradigm characterized by the Joy of the Lord (Isa. 56:7) where worship and intercession is sustained 24 hours a day.
 We are seeing many of these Houses of Prayer birthed right here in America and throughout other Nations around the globe. Many regions are already connecting with the Heart of Jesus and are moving in 24/7 worship and intercession.
 This too is the future vision for Forerunner House of Prayer. We are asking God to send us singers, musicians, and people who have a heart to pray. Will you be one who will partner with the Heart of God and answer that prayer?]]></description>

What is GHOP?
The Greenville House of Prayer (GHOP) is a prayer and ministry base located in the heart of Greenville, SC that serves Jesus and His purposes in the earth and is moving toward the ultimate goal of being a 24/7 prayer and missions base.

On May 8, 2007, GHOP was founded by Kris Miyake and eight "intercessory missionaries" who cried out to God in prayer with worship for four hours every Tuesday night in a small room at VHM Records. Now GHOP has developed into a thriving house of prayer thats committed to worship, intercession, and authentic discipleship while serving the city of Greenville. We believe ministry is done best when our lives are rooted in prayer and worship that focuses on intimacy with God hence our commitment to such a lifestyle.

GHOP is not affiliated with any one particular congregation or denomination because we desire for Jesus to see the unity he prayed for in John 17 become a reality for the Church in Greenville.  We believe one of our mandates is to contend in prayer for this unity and to serve the Body of Christ towards the fulfillment of this promise.
What is the vision of GHOP?
To establish 24/7 prayer and worship to unite the Body of Christ and see Gods plans and purposes fulfilled in our city.  

We see Gods house being restored to the house of prayer that it?s called to be, resulting in a unified Body of Christ across racial, denominational, and economics lines that is passionate for Jesus and His Kingdom. We see true disciples of Jesus being made as believers return to their first love and are rooted in the place of prayer.  Out of this place of intimacy and discipleship, we see intercessory missionaries being sent to preach the gospel to all nations, ultimately ushering in the return of King Jesus as He establishes His reign on the earth.   We believe we can help accomplish the above as we facilitate 24/7 prayer, worship and intercession that?s grounded in Christ-centered Community, Unity, and Discipleship.
What is the mission of GHOP?
To co-labor with Holy Spirit and the universal Body of Christ to establish 24/7 prayer for the purpose of: 

1.) Fulfilling the Great Commission. 
2.) Uniting the Body of Christ. 
3.) Exalting the Name of Jesus. 
4.) Loving God and Loving People. 

We believe our mission will be accomplished as we give ourselves to the narrow path while also calling others to a sacrificial lifestyle of devotion to Jesus. We desire to live and promote an authentic relationship with God that is characterized by the fruits and gifts of the Spirit. We believe this life of intimacy and power will spring out of a strong dedication to prayer, worship, fasting, simplicity, giving, community, missions, and deep encounter in the Word of God.]]></description>

Firehouse Underground is a coffee house for people to come and enjoy healing and encouragement. Attached to it is UHOP - Underground House of Prayer. 

The vision of UHOP is to be a prayer ministry that serves the body of Christ through intercession for His people, for the Lord wants the lost brought into a vibrant living church. We are committed to praying for all issues of LIFE: ?for He came that we might have life and have it to the full,? John 10:10. We love Jesus and seek intimacy with Him: ?You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all you mind,? Matthew 22:37. We gather as forerunners, watching the times and seasons: ?Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober,? 1 Thes. 5:6.]]></description>

The GAP House of Prayer, opened on 09/09/09 and is located in Murfreesboro, TN.  As of 12/12/12 we are in our new location just a few blocks south of Middle Tennessee State University.  Here we are raising up a tabernacle of David ministry in the city.

Called to be a pillar of cloud by day and a piller of fire by night.

During the daylight hours, we have a quiet atmosphere with instrumental or soft worship music.  A time and place of personal devotion, bible study, journaling and seeking Gods face.

When the sun sets we stoke up the fire with times of corporate worship and prayer.  We come together, seeking the heart of God and stand in the GAP concerning our Community, our Nation and the World, as the Lord leads]]></description>

Our mission is to worship the Lord Jesus Christ, proclaiming His triumph on the cross, to join Him in His priestly intercession in prayer, and to train forerunners in the intimate knowledge and fullness of God.

The concept of 24 hour a day prayer might seem strange to some. However, there are biblical, historical, and contemporary examples of this type of ministry existing, and having great impact. Below is a brief overview of this type of ministry]]></description>

We have purposed to build this work with the heart of a family of love made perfect in oneness with the Triune God; the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Jn 17:22-23). Our focus is to build the House of Zerubbabel, a 24/7 prayer and worship center as a banqueting table set for the city of Dallas. The prayer furnace will serve as the centerpiece of an equipping center with interns living in community. The equipping center will teach this capstone generation to enter into a life of the knowledge of God and unity with the Spirit resulting in the greater works (Matt 14:12) and operating in the governmental authority of God. We are creating a lifestyle of community reflecting Acts 2:42]]></description>

Injustice and immorality are spiritual issues and must be conquered through spiritual means. Historically nations have shifted through prayer and fasting. We invite you to join us in the Lord?s strategy of releasing the kingdom through prayer and worship.

Our prayer meetings are informal and led by musicians. Music unites hearts in a unique way and increases our ?joy in the house of prayer? (Isaiah 56:7). Meetings are held at 5818 Southwest Freeway in Houston. Stay tuned for updated prayer hours!]]></description>

The Lake Travis Prayer Room is located at River in the Hills Church in Lakeway, TX. It is a place where you can spend time worshiping God and seeking His face in prayer. All over the world God is raising up a prayer movement that is intent on making a place for the Lord to dwell, and worshiping Jesus simply because He is worthy of it.]]></description>

As a community of believers, we have been compelled by the Holy Spirit to contend for a harvest of young people, trained as prophetic singers, musicians and intercessors, who will create a 24/7 house of worship and prayer in the spirit of the tabernacle of David.  We believe that the establishment of 24/7 worship and prayer in our region will act as a greenhouse to equip end-time forerunner messengers to prepare the earth for the Lords return]]></description>

According to all reports and observations, God is raising up prayer in an unprecedented way in our lifetime. The Lord Jesus promised that his Father?s house would be a house of prayer for all nations (Mark 11:17 ; Isaiah 56:6-7). Prayer is to characterize the house of the Lord, both individually and corporately. What have we made of the Lord?s house? Does it look like a place devoted to the priority of prayer? Or, does it reflect the plans, programs, and priorities of people? Both individually and collectively, the Lord is restoring his people to the place and priority of prayer. Giving yourself to corporate intercession is one way to prime the pump of your personal prayer life. Here are some places where you can gather with others to pray and meet with the Lord (Matthew 18:19 -20).]]></description>

God has always desired to have a dwelling place with man. He says His house is a "house of prayer for all nations." The Tabernacle of David in 1,000BC was the full expression of that desire, and God promised to raise it up again in the last days. All over the globe, God is raising up houses of prayer and at River City House of Prayer, we are answering that call and have a vision to raise up a 24/7 house of prayer in our city. We consider it a privilege to be involved in this global move of God.]]></description>

The vision is to see the Austin area covered in unceasing prayer (1 Thes. 5:17) by 31+ churches until Jesus returns!

The vision is a unified church with one heart, one mind and one prayer to see God transform our city!

The vision is a growing number of pastors leading their churches in 24 hours (1 day) a month in unceasing prayer]]></description>

As God is the same yesterday, today and forever, when Moses received heavens model for fellowship with God, we see how the Lord moves all 12 tribes to advance into the promised land. So is true today as His Spirit unites the tribes/churches spiritually in a region to work together to advance the Kingdom of God and witness regional  ?Transformation?

UHOP is not trying to create one mega church, as some have wondered,? but more than that ? all His family praying strategically and communicating as a covering for one another. Helping each other as God pours out His Spirit, and prepares our churches for over flow harvest beyond our abilities to manage, Are we there yet, what did God tell Ezekiel to prophecy to ?dem bones?!!! ?LIVE?. What did they become, a vast army.

From my 5 short years in St. George, one thing I like about how God arranged His Body... there are a lot of different styles and anointing. When we witness to new comers in SG, and ask them what kind of church atmosphere they would you like to enjoy, we have a wonderful array of character from old school to modern, from gospel hymns to rock and roll, and all of them with a strict adherence to Biblical evidence?Thank Go]]></description>

Charlottesville House of Prayer is a Presence based community serving Central Virginia, committed to day and night worship,prayer and  partnership with God to reveal His glory and extend His kingdom on the earth.  

God is bringing awakening on the earth through the Love of the bridegroom Jesus and the response of the church according to the FOUR DEVOTIONS found in Acts 2:42-47:

C-HOP is devoted to the Presence and Kingdom of God by:
1. Devotion to Prayer  - See Acts 2:42  ( They were devoted to prayer?)
We have been meeting to minister to God by waiting upon Him, hearing and partnering with what he says. This has been our spiritual meat and drink.

2. Devotion to Worship - See Acts 2:42  (? devoted to the breaking of bread..)
We meet corporately as the Bride of Christ to adore Jesus because He is worthy of all honor praise and adoration! 

3. Devotion to Word of God - See Acts 2:42 (.. devoted to the Apostles teaching..)
We gather around the Word of God; the Bible. The Spirit of God (in accordance with John 14:26) is teaching us and revealing the Living Word to us. 

4. Devotion to the Fellowship of Believers - See Acts 2:42 (.. devoted to the fellowship..)
As we follow the second commandment to love each other, God is building culture of honor. God is making us a people of radical love and devotion to one another.]]></description>

We are a passionate congregation; excited about the vision God has given us.

A vision to see families established according to the Word of God and to see broken families restored and equipped to serve with excellence.

A vision to see racial and social reconciliation and unity in the Body of Christ. The Church should be a place where every person is welcome regardless of color, creed, or social status. Each individual is precious to God and should be treated in that fashion.

A vision to see our young men and women loving and serving Christ from childhood and being equipped to become leaders that will take the Body of Christ boldly into the future.

A vision to reach our communities within a 30 mile radius with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

A vision to develop ministry teams to be sent out from this church into the nations of the world.

A vision to impact the world in missions by training others to build thriving churches in their own environments.

Perhaps you are one of the people that God would like to plant in this Local Assembly.

May the Lord?s blessings be upon you as you prayerfully consider HIS will for Your lives]]></description>

Our Vision

The Northern Virginia House of Prayer (NOVA HOP) is a day and night prayer room serving Northern Virginia and our Nation. Two figures from the Bible who inspire us in this are Anna, the first evangelist and forerunner in the New Testament, who prayed and fasted for over sixty years before Jesus first coming (Lk. 2:37), and King David who organized and paid 4,000 musicians and 288 singers to worship God day and night (1 Chr. 23:1 - 25:31). A perpetual solemn assembly gathering corporately to pray in the spirit of the tabernacle of David. 


Our Goals

1. To maintain an expression of day and night prayer and worship, in the spirit of the tabernacle of David, as our central focus for the transformation of Northern Virginia and our nation.

2. To call forth, train, and mobilize intercessors to prayer as they preach the gospel, heal the sick, help the needy, make disciples, and seek to bring transformation to society; to make it our aim to personally live as fully devoted disciples of Jesus.

3. We are committed to prayer, fasting, the Great Commission, and plugging people into the local church. 



The work of NOVA HOP Missions Base will include equipping and sending out missionaries as dedicated intercessors and evangelists who work to see revival within the Church and the marketplace. Join with us as we set our hearts to love God, worship Him alone, and dedicate our lives to serving Him without reservation; to demonstrate our love for others in works of service, justice, outreach, and compassion; and to proclaim the return of Jesus]]></description>

Richmond International House of Prayer (RIHOP) is a gathering of worshipers and intercessors from various congregations working towards a non-stop, 24/7 house of prayer and worship in the heart of Richmond. Our prayers are mingled with worship throughout the watches as a fragrant offering to the Lord. Mission Statement: To gather, train and mobilize musicians, worshipers and intercessors for the purpose of establishing a multi-congregational 24/7 Worship and Prayer Center in the Spirit of the Tabernacle of David which will undergird the transformation processes engaged by the corporate Body of Messiah in the greater Richmond area and beyond.]]></description>

My story I believe is one of many that are part of a great end time story of God purpose in seeing the original host peoples of North America the American and Canadian Indians come into the fullness of their destiny as original gatekeepers and steward of this land we live in.

 What the enemy tried to do to extinguish their existence on this continent is now being turned around by Gods unyielding purpose for a time such as now to bring healing to the land.   God has stored a secret weapon within our midst that is now being released for the purposes of Gods Kingdom.  

We as a ministry recognize our destiny is intertwined in covenant with the destiny of the original host peoples of this land.   It is also clear that the Lord is rising up true Apostolic First Nations Leaders that will be generals of the faith and lead the charge.  These Generals dont see themselves as separate form Gods ecclesia, His church but are coming forth for a time such as this to see the church move further into its destiny and authority on the earth.   

 One of these Generals we have come into covenant relationship with is Kenny Blacksmith of Gathering Nations International, who we would dishonor with out mentioning his ministry partner and powerful women of God his wife Louise. Kenny is a former deputy Grand Chief of the Cree peoples in Northern Quebec who has accepted   this call of heaven to carry a national and international platform to call forth the original host peoples Canada and beyond to take there rightful place in Gods end time plan.  It is also important to mention that we not only see Kenny as one of our Apostles over this ministry but also see Kenny and Louise as our dear friends who we love and are the Godparents of our children]]></description>

The International House Of Prayer of Edmonds, WA (IHOP-WA) is intended to be a base for restoring the Tabernacle of David: It is, first of all, a mission-training center, that creates an environment to train intercessory missionaries. IHOP-WA also serves as a context within which these intercessory missionaries can meet one another, Fellowship and form teams. These teams would then commit to be sent forth to start 24-hour prayer ministries in the cities of the earth, working under the apostolic leadership already present in those cities.]]></description>

The vision that we have for the International House of Prayer Northwest is to establish a place of night and day intercessory worship focusing on encountering the beautiful God with a burning heart of love for His people. As we give ourselves to this we believe that a whole generation of young adults and children will give themselves to this calling in an extravagant way. Many will spend their lives ministering to the Lord seeking to agree with His will for the earth and calling to Him to establish His Kingdom on the earth as it is in Heaven. Many others will become those who will declare the message of the coming of Jesus with passion and power cultivated in the prayer room. The goal of this prayer ministry and of the preaching of the Word of God is to prepare the way for the return of Jesus Christ to the earth. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!]]></description>

PRAYER ROOM

There is always a lot going on at Light of the World Prayer Center, and central to everything is our growing Prayer Room which is open to the public M-F 9am - 6pm and for designated other times for "Harp & Bowl" sets. The Prayer Room has been designed to reflect the tabernacle of David (1 Chr. 22?24); it is a place where we never cease worshiping the Lord and interceding for our world. Our goal is to reach a full 24/7 prayer schedule.

We want you to feel comfortable, whether as a participant or an anonymous visitor. You are welcome to come and go freely and to stay in the prayer room as long as you like. While in the prayer room, feel free to join in with the corporate worship and prayer, read your Bible, study a favorite commentary, write in your journal, or engage in private prayer. You may sit, stand, or pace up and down the aisles. Whatever you do, we ask that you do it in a manner that honors and serves the other people in the room]]></description>

Dominion House of Prayer is a non denominational body of Christ that came into being as a result of a divine call of God to establish a house of prayer for our GOD according to: 

Isaiah 56: 7 - "...My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations" 

-Matthew 28: 18-20 - "...All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

Genesis 1: 26-31 - "...God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion of the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth..."

Luke 10:17-19 - "...And He said unto them, I beheld satan as a lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you." 

Mark 16: 15-16 - "He said to them, GO into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when the drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well." 

Ephesians 4: 7-16 - "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: when He ascended on high, He led captives in his train and gave gifts to men. What does He ascended mean except that He also descended to the lower earthly regions. He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe. It was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare Gods people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

You are therefore welcome to partner with the Holy Spirit to do greater works to the Glory of our God.]]></description>

The International House of Prayer - Lake Superior is a community of believers who have dedicated themselves to Jesus for a unique season of thier lives. Made up of old and young, we have committed ourselves to labor together to establish a night and day prayer room in the spirit of the Tabernacle of David. We have committed ourselves to prayer, fasting and the great commission through intercession, preaching and mercy deeds.

A significant and unique focus of the house of prayer is to live as forerunners, preparing ourselves and others for the unique dynamics of the end times.

The vision before us is vast. We are looking for those who love Jesus to join us to see a night and day Prayer Room established. Although the International House of Prayer will be established on the labors of full-time intercessors, we have a place for anyone who so desires to co-labor with us as we set our hearts on this life-long journey. If you have more questions, come see us, wed love to talk with you!

The Prayer Room

At the heart of the International House of Prayer - Lake Superior is the Prayer Room, where we labor together to see a breakthrough and release of power and blessing in our region, nation and the earth. To this end we will continue to labor until the earth is filled with the knowledge and glory of God.

The prayer room is freely open for anyone to come and enjoy whenever we are holding a prayer meeting]]></description>

The Furnace IHOP UW Madison is. . .
A prayer and worship center and an outpost for evangelism located in the heart of downtown Madison.
A place of encounter which ignites hearts to burn 24/7.
The convergence of the prayer and worship movement with the missions revival to advance the Kingdom of God.
As we exalt Jesus, in the beauty and holiness of who He is, He will draw all men unto himself and they will encounter the power of His love.  We are convinced that the Kingdom of God is advanced through the furnace of prayer and worship.  All ministry flowing from that place of the first commandment ? Loving God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.  In this posture, we are empowered and ignited to live out the second commandment  ? love your neighbor as yourself.
What is it for?
?The Furnace? is a space that is given as an offering to God and a gift to our city for the purpose of igniting passion for Jesus Christ.  From all spheres of society ? government, campus, marketplace/business, to family units and individuals, God is calling out to people to know Him, and be known by Him.   We have heard His heart and have received a mandate to raise up a company of God lovers and God seekers and God pleasers, who are sold out to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

Passion for God is developed and nurtured in the atmosphere of prayer and worship. This environment, where God?s words are spoken, God?s name is exalted, and God?s heart is revealed to the seeker?this environment cultivates revelation of the love of the Lord Jesus Christ and empowers the believer to advance His Kingdom!
Strategies are birthed in the womb of intercession for city transformation.  As transformed lives transform cities, strategies are released for the tearing down of strongholds through repentance, prophecy, and going forth in the opposite spirit of the world. It is the delight of the Father to give His children the keys of the Kingdom.
How does it work?
The Furnace is the heartbeat of Advance K Ministries. It was formed to pursue the presence of God, similar to the tabernacle of David (1 Chronicles 22?24).  It is the place where we worship the Lord and intercede for our community and our world.  The worship sets transition throughout the day, and each is guided by the heart of intercession, worship with the Word, prophetic worship and soaking worship as Holy Spirit leads.
What goes on?
There may be ?soaking? songs where the love of God is powerfully expressed, or there may be more intense and aggressive sounds of intercession and high praises.  This is a place where you can behold the beauty of God, worship with abandonment in dance, spend time in Bible study, commune with God, engage in prophetic intercession, create prophetic art or receive prophetic prayer from one of our staff. We believe the arts are a powerful way of expressing worship to God.  In creativity, hearts can express the inexpressible via music, poetry, painting, drawing, drama, or danc]]></description>

The Furnace Kenosha is a new House of Prayer in Southeastern Wisconsin with services on Saturday night, with soon to be added prayer sessions during the week.  The goal, a 24/7 House of Prayer.

God is calling a generation into wholehearted obedience, to be a catalyst for the spreading of His goodness and mercy. 

Our vision is to reach young people with the radical love of Jesus through passionate worship, intercessory prayer, dynamic discipleship, and social justice.

Our dream is that Isaiah 61 would become a reality. 

When we worship and intercede, we are partnering with Gods heart on what he wants to do on the earth. This is vital in our vision to bring the kingdom of heaven to earth. The Lord is raising up singers, musicians and intercessors to show the goodness of God. 

Acts 2 gives us a picture on how the Church should be and that is our model. Community is a vital piece of how Gods kingdom is run. We want to walk out how to love each other like Jesus did so we can love the world the same way.

We want Jesus to be known to every sphere of society. In order to do that we have to get out and go where the people are. We want to serve our community, neighborhood and city any way we can so the lost will be saved through encountering Jesus.]]></description>

The Valley House of Prayer is a day and night worship and prayer community. We are committed to worshiping Jesus continually through music and arts with prayer. Our purpose is to maintain a continuous fire of prayer and worship before the Lord. We are working towards having our prayer room staffed around the clock for anyone to come and spend time in prayer before the Lord. We also hold Encounter the King Gatherings (EKG), where we train believers in intimacy with Christ, living a lifestyle of prayer, and the urgency of the hour]]></description>

We meet every Tuesday from 7:00 pm until whenever to Worship & Pray. (come and go as you like)
Description
My house shall be called a house of prayer... Jesus.
General Information
This page is for anyone interested in worship and prayer.
We are focused on engaging the presence of the living God in whatever capacity He chooses to reveal himself.

Encounter with the Father changes us.

Matthew 21:13
13He said to them, The Scripture says, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.


Haggai 1:3-4
3Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying, 4 Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house [of the Lord] lies in ruins?


We are now the Temple. Our bodies are the House of God. Lets rebuild our temples together. Lets not be content merely to go to church, but lets be the church.

We meet every Tuesday night at 7 in the "Deep River Creative" building across from City Hall in Downtown Lewisburg.]]></description>

Shiloh House of Prayer is located just outside of Charleston, West Virginia?s capital city in Teays Valley. We have a vision to establish 24/7 prayer and worship in the Charleston area. We believe that night and day prayer will change the spiritual atmosphere of a city, thus preparing the way for anointed evangelism, revival, and transformation (Luke 18:1-7). Night and day prayer is more that just a good idea ? It is the welcoming committee that will usher in the very presence of God!

ShiHOP is committed to equip and train up a generation who will offer up themselves to a lifestyle of prayer and fasting, worship, and study of the Word. Our ministries exemplify the core values of the gospel: reach out to the lost (preach the gospel), heal the sick, set the captives free (deliverance and inner healing), and do works of justice (ending abortion and human trafficking, adoption of children in foster care and orphans, crisis response, care for the poor) . We teach people to prophesy, move in the gifts and the power of the Holy Spirit.
Through many different encounters, God has given us a mandate to be part of His global prayer movement at the end of the age. We are open to believers of all denominations and ages as a place to gather for prayer and worship.  Although we are still in our early stages of growth, we have many opportunities for service and involvement]]></description>

Wyoming Prayer Network
 
is a centralized effort to network people from many ministries and to disperse information and prayer focuses across Wyoming.  
 
We hope to facilitate unity in the body of Christ through prayer groups using prayer and intercession, and by holding Concerts of Prayer which will set the atmosphere for transformation through prayer, repentance, and reclaiming, in individuals, cities, states, this nation and the nations of the world.We desire to function as a well-trained army having many parts but at special appointed times, speaking as one voice with multiplied strength to break certain strongholds altogether.
 
 
The church is not a building, but made up of all believers of Jesus Christ.  Every believer makes up a part of ?the body? with Christ being the head]]></description>
